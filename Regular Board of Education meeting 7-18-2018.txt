[00:08:00]
Board of Education operates we want you to know that you are welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting and public forum upon signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outline those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting tonight there are less than 15 speakers so therefore to accommodate everyone each speaker has two minutes for comments within 30 minutes public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you are always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you're unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak within the 30-minute public forum Board of Education encourages you just stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn and only at this time of year concerns be addressed at the discretion

[00:09:00]
have each board member so our first speaker is Franklin Ghana my name is Franklin County race in the district and it got me to thinking I have decided to stick with love because hate is too great of a bear of a burden to bear Dr Martin Luther King Jr 50 years ago I'm really glad for the reminder of the behavior because when you talk about race

[00:10:00]
add white people and black people and also the the perceptions that white people have of black people without them even knowing it you need civil Behavior you need it it's the only thing that controls us to be able to speak to each other in a civil manner policies and procedures for districts as big as APS need to be changed and they need to be looked at Volcano Vista does anybody remember that does anybody remember that before Volcano Vista APS leadership 4 days before that happened something about a race training and when when does decided to come and talk to the president of the board of education at that

[00:11:00]
time he said no civil disobedience is important for next speaker is Brian Hoover good morning I'm here to ask some questions about school security I realize that you made these questions to be asked offline but since the Parkland massacre in February I have written multiple emails made multiple phone calls left voicemails for the aps police chief deputy and superintendent

[00:12:00]
and had no response no response whatsoever I don't understand why those contact information is on the internet if if there's not going to be a response so here I am with two questions first is what has APS done since Parkland to improve school security or at the very least evaluate school security second question I did discover some existing Common Sense security policies for instance policy Ki regarding visitors to schools which is an obvious concern this policy states quote visitors Cal verify their identity but these are not uniformly implemented when I asked our principal about checking IDs she said she's not

[00:13:00]
comfortable asking for IDs of visitors so my question to is are these policies mandatory or do principals have discretion on on which policies to implement and if they are mandatory what is APS doing to ensure compliance thank you I'm here on behalf of my cell phone and I have not been cleared of a background check which according to judge in short of

[00:14:00]
unable to expunge my record I should be cleared of all I was never charged of a crime I was never prosecuted so I want to ask the board if they can dig a little deeper into my case I'm at the school on a daily basis and I have a son with special needs who I had to restrain in 2007 so that's where the child abuse charges were allegedly I was accused of allegedly I guess of child abuse charges so in cleared so I guess I just want to know the next steps that I need to take I've been working with the chief of police and through APS and I forget her name the other lady I work with for two years I've been pretty much locked out of my child's lives at school so I feel like I need someone to hear the case

[00:15:00]
play a little deeper and then I think I should be able to be cleared do I get responses from anybody at this not until the end later okay and I have apparently that's here to speak on my behalf also thank you so our last speaker is Nora Lujan good afternoon and I'm here to support Morris

[00:16:00]
after school because of course she's not clear to do anything during the school hours and she's always helping she's always cooking she's always helping me in the classroom and anybody that knows about you know parents is very hard to actually bring in parents into the school and Yolanda has been like I'm here of course we're on vacation but even right now we are going to the school and watering the plants because we don't want the garden helping me and always seeing what she can do for us so again you know I'm repeating myself I want to you know for you guys to look at this because for the past two years has tried to clear her record for her and I really

[00:17:00]
do believe that we need their parents like that like her and I really feel that you know what she had to be cleared thank you so very much thank you for your input that concludes public forum thank you I'm going to the superintendent report thank you president Pearcy for members of the board community members and staff first thing I'd like to do is I'd like to announce a new member of the aps family who was born not too long ago and will be graduating in 2036 I will be there to shake her hands on Bowman she's a beautiful daughter of Dr Richard Bowman I just want to welcome her to the family Albuquerque Public Schools on proof scores on the park

[00:18:00]
this is a state required tests with an average gain of 3.5% points in English language arts and 1.6 percentage points in math the greatest gains were seen in 4th grade which improved 5% points and scores in 6/7 and 10th grade all improved by 4% points or more math scores improved in grades three through seven and an algebra 1 with the greatest gains of 3% of points or more in third fifth and 7th grade scores in the 8th grade math geometry and algebra two were down slightly so we're going to have to look at that and see why that occurred in that manner but the greatest three-year greens were made in 7th grade English language arts and fourth grade math which both increased by 6% points 8th grade English

[00:19:00]
start 3-year increase of 5.7% points so it's been a gradual we haven't fallen back and I think that that speaks volumes about the consistency in the continuity of instruction that our children are getting and more than half of all 11th grade students now meet or exceed expectations in English language arts the three a PS schools identified by the state as in need of more rigorous intervention or MRIs in proved test scores and some of the possible reasons for the all of these increase scores include budgetary adjustments and here we are I'm so glad that we were able to praise the work that was being done as far as really have put more resources back into the school in to the classrooms the creation of learning zones design

[00:20:00]
I want to meet the unique needs of the school community Through support resources and professional learning and a lot of hard work and the use of data including test scores to drive instruction intervene when students fall behind and Taylor programs to fifth individual needs of our students and again this kind of tells nicely with our academic master plan and I think we're seeing some nice results and please to see the improvements and look forward to what what will come next year the aps Education Foundation is hosting an online silent auction it is sponsored by Concerta and includes items and services donated by local businesses to help raise funds for Innovative programs in APS schools auction items range and value from 42 to 1600 dollars and includes sporting events gift certificates are jewelry and vacations the

[00:21:00]

[00:22:00]
taking advantage of in that we're we're offering the graduation ceremony is really very colorful it's got students from APS Comprehensive High Schools magnet schools and Charter Schools wearing caps and gowns in their school colors and it's just a true celebration and I'm excited to be part of the ceremony to celebrate with these students and their families the Albuquerque Public Schools administrators conference on education or Ace will be held July the 25th through the 28th at the Albuquerque Marriott the conference is an opportunity to engage APS leaders

[00:23:00]
what is in professional development motivational speeches and opportunities for networking and one thing that I need to mention that we've been having Ace over 50 years now I think it's 56 or something like that no other District does this very few states that I know of in fact I don't know of any other state that does this but it is invaluable and we look forward to it every single year and even in times of budget cuts and prices that was something that we felt needed to continue because we value the opportunity to come together as administrators and share ideas and we just love Ace I look forward to participating in the conference and now I'm not going to be in the talent show I'm saying that right now I'm also looking forward to starting the school year and and like I said today this morning and take message that we put together at K&W or my favorite radio station

[00:24:00]
Barcelona Escolar the exito is this is going to be a really successful Academic Year we're looking forward to it that's the concludes my superintendent's report thank you thank you we'll go on to special issues the first issue is the update on the law was on the leadership academy the discussion item presenter's office and will have a we'll have a presentation by you all and then who is the governor of 3 minutes for a public forum statement after that okay and then we'll have a discussion by the board thank you just come back and give an update on the happening since the

[00:25:00]
June 25th meeting since then La Rosalina Leadership Academy has filed an appeal with the New Mexico Secretary of Education and we wanted tonight to come and just talk about options and get your direction for for potential next steps and answer any questions that you may have in that vein I always like to contextualize any decisions that we make in the bigger picture and the bigger strategy and what we're trying to accomplish and so as we as we think back to our portfolio strategy which is really looking at how do we provide a portfolio if you will or a variety of different options that meet students different learning needs of families and meets for Workforce preparation in our district in our city our decisions that we make in the office of innovation and school choice are always kind of Guided by that North Star of looking at what options are needed to enhance the portfolio

[00:26:00]
schools that we have thinking of a portfolio in terms of like an artist portfolio a portfolio of your best work that shows all the different kinds of things that you can do so I wanted to just call us back to that that bigger purpose since the June 25th meeting as I said Larose Alana has filed an appeal the legal counsel of APS and La Rosalina have met and conferred with each other to explore the different on statutory options of which there are several which doctor will go into a little bit more detail about Mr President in addition we provided you the briefing document which you've seen before regarding contracts and closures on the second page of that briefing document on contracts and

[00:27:00]
you'll notice State Statute 22889 which really guides how a charter school contract shall be executed and so this is really regarding option one because the appeal to the secretary was made on the basis of the that the chart the contract was not finalized and that there was a disagreement about the contract so one option is that the appeal would go forward and continue through that process with the Secretary of Education where he can if you notice in that yellow highlighted portion of the contract final and we would move forward with authorizing them and they would continue to operate another option would be to bring forward their contract and move forward with some conditions that you might consider

[00:28:00]
so for example a one of the some of the things that we've discussed is really understanding who they have in charge of special ed a possible interim executive director a path forward to a new executive director holding a public meeting to clearly articulate to parents their the concerns that we've had and their path forward their corrective action plan another option would be to bring forward and this is also in your briefing documents it's the 4th or 5th page where really another highlighted area under Section following the procedures for actual formal revocation and so that that is another option for you to consider is

[00:29:00]
is actually formalizing the revocation of the school which would move forward with if if the board so choose to vote to actually close the school and I included the aps procedural directive on that process so the school has taken some steps forward and Mr lemming I don't know if it's appropriate at this time for him to address the the board but we do stand for questions but we just wanted to provide you kind of the context of the issue hey Google it's just like normal and I'm sorry I'm sorry

[00:30:00]
2 minutes sorry guy Mr President members of the board thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak this evening we indeed met with your counsel as well as ours in addition to Debbie Elder and Joseph Escobedo about the steps that we needed to take moving forward and I think that we at the end of that meeting were ending up on the same page and I appreciate the input from the aps staff on this and so I'm going to jump right into it I'm not here tonight to offer any excuses for the concerns that you all identified I'm here to offer a constructive path forward in accordance with the items that were discussed in the meeting that we had with Debbie Elder Joseph Jessica the first thing is that we heard your concerns and did not take them lightly we will have an interim head administrator in place on Monday I had the opportunity to meet with an individual this week and we are negotiating

[00:31:00]
sing the the particulars of it but moving forward the the individual heading up the transition is no longer going to be Justina Montoya who will be retiring and out of the school completely on September 4th the interim administrator between Monday the 23rd I believe through that period of time or give or take when we find a permanent replacement on that note we have posted the job posting through aps's Services as well as the Coalition of charter schools to replace our headed administrator with a permanent person and we will I anticipate applications not one but two Community meetings in order to better reach our our community some of them are able to get there in the evenings and some aren't able to get there in the mornings and so we covered our bases by having two one in the morning on a weekend one of the evening on a weekend night to accommodate everybody so that we can get

[00:32:00]
the most important that we can in addition to that we have had candidates applying who we are in the process of interviewing for the special education the second special education teacher position we have indeed hired a special education teacher who is on board who has met with the aps special education liaison to discuss the corrective action plan and enacting that moving forward so I think by taking all of those steps which were pretty clearly outlined in our meeting with Art Melendez and Joseph Escobedo and Debbie Elder I think that took into account your concerns that you stated and I just wanted to emphasize the point that I'm not here to make excuses about the concerns you identified but that we are being very proactive in addressing those concerns and I believe that in our cooperation with collaboration rather with elders

[00:33:00]
so Joseph we have board comments from anybody any thoughts from anybody yes but remember Peterson I guess one of the questions is what's the time frame for the appeal process so the appeal process support on this one but I believe the general time frame is that the general counsel from the public education department would ask for briefs from both parties and then scheduling a hearing between 30 and 45 days so what

[00:34:00]
what what was the same page that that you all ended up on what after you met with legal councils I am confused about what the actual recommendation is coming from you all president Piercy and board member Peterson members of the board we are not bringing forth a new recommendation we are here to clarify what's happening in the process when an appeal is filed and I'm going to look to mister Melinda to verify the school continues to exist and like it's sort of like stay put things don't change as long as there's the as long as the appeal is in process and so as such the meeting with the governing Council chair and Laura's cancel came to some discussion around what they're going to do in the meantime

[00:35:00]
I'm as the appeal is in its process their feeling is that they don't want to just sit and do nothing they want to take the proactive steps that the president lemming described so that if the appeal is if the if the contract is sent back to you all that they would have a constructive path forward which of course we support those action steps we aren't again recommending a path forward we're just giving an update and we'd like to hear from you your thoughts on what you're hearing this evening does that answer your question so then school will by the time the whole appeal process goes through school will already have

[00:36:00]
is that correct Mr President so if the secretary decides that the school will be will be closed then when will that happen will it happen after the kids have already started school which is very concerning Mr President so following the revocation process if you were to vote in another meeting to actually revoke the charter then the school would cease to exist in 30 days and that's following that process and but they would have an opportunity to file an appeal on the revocation so I'm assuming that that process would be the same for for the secretary if the secretary determined that the contract was not valid okay so then they have another

[00:37:00]
opportunity after that one when it comes to revocation so they can appeal that as well as if the board were to choose to revoke then the the revocation would be on the principles of the matter what the confusion is is the lack of the approval of the contract if we follow current state statute the appeal is just on the disagreement about contract language not about the concerns that the board has expressed in that the district has expressed about special and compliance so they're kind of two different issues so then we have another vote on revocation though we approved the charter we renew the charter in December I mean I know I wasn't here for that but that's when that happened so then we would have like a second vote about that then you would have a you would have a hearing about

[00:38:00]
revocation in making a tournament on termination on that you know as I described to the National Association of charter school authorizers today when we were getting some guidance from them is this is the convergence of you know we haven't had this situation before where we have a contract that's ready to be approved but a major concern or problem that we found and in this case special at compliance okay so then they have the correction action plan that was written in conjunction with with APS so then I don't know if you can answer this or Mr lemming they are continuing with that corrective action plan so the Mr President the corrective action plan has been submitted by the by the school they have developed that are who is the special education

[00:39:00]
did provide some input and has recommended that the corrective action plan be accepted so they are moving forward with taking care of some of those things we will be monitoring that throughout this next year and in fact we've already set some deadlines we will be looking at things in September October November to be able to come to back to you no matter what your decision is to let you know in December the status of the corrective action plan so then do they have to do for the corrective action plan I kind of I mean I read over this then do they have to have I know they said reasonable opportunity to remedy the problem so what is reasonable opportunity that they have to have so much time that it has to be done in a timely manner or a reasonable amount of time and it's not defined so were they even given a reasonable amount of

[00:40:00]
name to carry this out Mr President the corrective action plan and it was accepted in early June and so that's why we are recommending to going in September October November monitor different pieces of that action plan to come back to you in December with a progress update to see how they have been able to implement that they have hired a special education director Mr molten he has had a preliminary meeting with our special education liaison and we are hopeful but we don't know how the progress will be until it is it is put into place so is that we have to give them time to carry out their corrective action plan I mean is that they shall be

[00:41:00]
is that time or is it well maybe Mr President Mueller Aragon I'm not sure what you're referring to what documents that I was just reading your briefing just your briefing so I think it was an F probably an f and then in like four l123 talked about allowing the charters a reasonable amount of time giving me notification for the governing body to remedy the problem requiring them to execute a corrective action plan so there's lots of giving them time giving them time I just want to know if that is something that is they may or they shall have that time because that's important those words are different so I just want to know if it's a May or if it's a shell

[00:42:00]
Mr President and Miss Mulatto going it is a shell okay so they weren't given that opportunity okay thank you yes board member so my question is like in the corrective action plan I would assume that they probably gave themselves some hopefully they did it's like some specific time lines and deadlines to me mister president so that would be a basis then if they're proposing their own timeline that's what we would be monitoring and when they would get it done because they would they would have to meet their own corrective action plan and proposal if that's what it's being recommended and and

[00:43:00]
he said that we should go forward with that doctor Percy Miss Victoria Court of a correct okay so my second question is around the community meetings with the parents that Mr lemming proposed that there is two Community meetings that are planned for parents what's the content of the meetings what what's the plan is it is the plan to let parents know a potential choice of of options of moving forward I'm just curious about what what's that was that mentioned at all in the timeline in terms of giving parents due diligence also in terms of knowing that the school is someone in a precarious situation how is that being communicated with parents Dr Peterson Toyota

[00:44:00]
able to tell you the proposed contents of that meeting yes so we've been fully transparent with our school community and letting them know what the situation is with regard to the contract and the board's action on that and as far as the content of those meetings is to address any questions or concerns that they may have about the situation that they are in and we are we are not interested in denying anybody information and so if they did want to move to another school that is certainly their right to do so and there's no reason why they wouldn't be able to do that or why we would tell them that they couldn't so we are doing this in the interest of transparency as a school Community because that's part of the culture of our school in the first place and we just want to make sure that as we move forward we are hearing input from our community and if they have ideas on the head administrator search or if they

[00:45:00]
have some idea about any part of this process as we're moving forward we're very interested to hear what they have to say can I just lost my train of thought because I did have a second my second question or my final question is really has has the enrollment dropped or do we know what the starting enrollment is going to be for the New Year to my knowledge enrollment hasn't dropped the only the only instance of a student who was the only instance of the circumstances and information that the parent and learn from the Press had decided to go to a different charter school that was reported in the Albuquerque Journal and that's the only instance I know of a student going elsewhere so what will be your starting enrollment I think it is 65

[00:46:00]
I'm if I'm not mistaken but I don't know the number at this time do we have an idea of what's that number of students with disabilities that will be starting the new year I also don't know what that number is serious vote that the board took was that you were going to proceed to close the school based on the fact that the contract was not improved and then I

[00:47:00]
what is the question about the appeal to the secretary and I was told that was correct they had that right some a little confused I'm confused about the numbers let me say the numbers at the time we were talking about 62 rather than 82 students and you know from from my point of view we've got mixed messages from you and I have never really been clear on what your recommendation was prior to this meeting my understanding from you when I asked you do we believe that this school can move forward based on the planet that had been presented and you said yes and then we got into the discussion about various issues of compliance now we're in a position

[00:48:00]
what I'm trying to figure out what did we vote on we certainly were lamb blasted in the press and by the bloggers calling us hypocritical etcetera etcetera and for me that's that's about as bad as it can get not to say that it couldn't get worse I don't want to predict that but you know we're just being sort of like a ping pong ball paddled one way and I want to find out what it is that we have authority to do and what is it that we don't have authority to do it sounds to me like what was said Indian Trump based on what you just said now was that one has been filed that sort of changes the rules we have to look at their contract for compliance therefore you had a meeting with the boards attorney as well as with the attorney from the school as well as the school and now

[00:49:00]
the person who's been monitoring this from your department is saying you're satisfied with their plan so I'm just a little confused and I don't know that I'll get much satisfaction for that confusion but I do need to say are we committing to working together Mr lemming that's my question to you mistress will you think we can work this out that's my question to you you know where do we go from here and why thank you first of all my apologies board meeting we did recommend approval of their contract based on the points that they had met all of the indicators that we had asked them to do which included them developing their own special education corrective action plan that triggered

[00:50:00]
best to be able to be able to bring back to you their contract at that meeting we recommended an approval of their contract based on the point that they had developed a successful corrective action plan which is required when we find a concern and so in the meantime you know the board voted to not approve the contract I will take responsibility for not having the experience and the knowledge of this particular situation that when a contract is not approved by an authorizer that there is a gray area that we believe in 22899 and so that is the basis of their appeal

[00:51:00]
if I had had more experience and in this situation I would have advised you at that time that you voted to not approve the contract to request that the board give me direct information as to take the next steps does that mean that the board wants me to take the next steps towards revocation and so this we have found kind of a disconnect between the charter school statutes that are in place and so to answer your question do I believe that we can move forward in our discussions with the school they were productive and the school is taking steps forward to move the school forward with including as what Mr Lemmings said looking for another executive director they do have a special ed director of those sorts of things

[00:52:00]
will you know I appreciate your your comments go ahead I just wanted to address your question about how we viewed working together I have always viewed this from the outset as a partnership with you guys as the authorizer and US operating under your authorization and it is my intention to work with you guys as stakeholders in the mission of our school and to serve the students who go to our school and I have no doubt in my mind that the steps that were taking are bold steps and that are going to result in constructive outcomes that I don't think we're fully understood for a number of reasons but I think right here is our opportunity to flush that out and really put it on the table that we are the good of our students and that's our intention and we are doing everything that has been expressed to us not

[00:53:00]
play from the board but through the staff members at APS as well we've been working very closely and I think we're very I'm very proud of having that relationship and being able to to make these constructive changes I don't necessarily think I remember reading that in your letter to the editor I did make a reminder to the reporter specifically thanking the board members who voted to approve the contract that wasn't reported in the Albuquerque Journal but I haven't emailed to prove it if you want to see it well I don't really have any confidence in our local urinal you know here's the deal I want to have a real clear understanding on where we're going and why we're going there I don't think that I got that the last time it was confusing it was hard on the board people voted their conscience based on their observations and reports that we received from the charter school department I want us to move forward for all children whether they be in

[00:54:00]
what are schools whether they be in charter schools we approve or to the state approved I'm not interested in playing political games back and forth but I want us to move forward but we have to be clear on what we're doing and I don't feel that I got Clarity so your explanation this evening Mr Escobedo I feel satisfied with that exclamation point I'm hopeful that I'm understanding you this time I thought I heard you say we were going to proceed with closing the school so at this point my opinion is it sounds like you've had a meeting of the minds and we're trying to work through the process to move forward so good morning

[00:55:00]
the school stays open during this process and that there is a constructive path forward for those 65 children in those parents in those families so that Mr Lemon put forward so I mean should we be talking about anything else other than a pill has been filed in the school stays open and are they on the right path I mean are we are we supposed to look forward I mean beyond that or are we just dealing with what's in front of us I think just giving us an updated status

[00:56:00]
and if Mr lemming knew that when he volunteered to be president of the governing Council that it would be a full-time position that concerned about the administrator of the school and I don't review briefings of demographic information on a regular basis we do go over these numbers in our monthly

[00:57:00]
greetings but those numbers have sort of taken a back seat to taking the actions that were suggested in response to the the Practical concerns of the board as far as what we can do to improve our school and so though I cannot give you that number I just don't have that knowledge but that doesn't mean that the knowledge doesn't exist it certainly does and that is something that if you like I guess we can take that conversation offline and I can provide you with all of that information that you need to talk about providing the education and I will get that information to you thank you thank you thank you

[00:58:00]
let me ask first of all what's the criteria for your leader you put out a job tell me what you can carry is right yes so we are looking for obviously a licensed administrator in the state of New Mexico and individual with a master's degree and I think the key aspect of what we put in our job posting was that we prefer a candidate with special education experience in the classroom and a familiarity with the statutes and regulations that exist around IEPs and special education programs in general we are putting a premium on that experience and so candidates who come in with that type of experience we are going to be looking at very closely and in the hopes that they will be able to see in addition to our new special ed

[00:59:00]
Mission director with 42 years of experience to make it a very strong program where our special education students are thriving so that that is a specific point that we put in our job posting in addition to the things that are required legally of an individual to hold that position in the state of New Mexico and I can get you a copy of that job description if you would like as well okay I think that's a difficult requirement but I think it would be a requirements in the whole time like I understand because sometime ago I think it was more than a year ago you came to us with the renewal for a lot and you recommendation at that time was closer

[01:00:00]
play recommendation is closer based on the fact they had a significant deficit in finances can you tell me at that time did we know anything about special ed issues Mr President members of the board the so two years ago the school did apply to renew their Charter coming from the public education commission and they we requested at that time information from the public education department on any corrective action that plans that they had been under the public education Department's Charter School Division did not notify us of any concerns during our visit process the school did 20014 the school did appeal to the secret

[01:01:00]
area of Education who requested that we negotiate with the school to move forward prior to a hearing being held so we did do that for like one year correct Mr President members of the board yes we gave him a one-year contract so then they they had one year that they had to almost immediately turn in their next renewal application because they're on October 1st just a few months after our oversight started October you came to us and indicated that their finances were kind of corrected and did you know that time whether there were any special education issues because now

[01:02:00]
Mr President said they had only been under our authorized Authority when we brought your recommendation in December and then we conducted our site visit in the spring so we had not had any site visits before then no we have not even though they had financed problems Mister president members of the committee financial reporting and so that that's not an official site visit but our finance was monitoring their finances monthly and insurance company so at that time when they brought their renewal in December we voted again on the renewal and there was some

[01:03:00]
patience about getting a contract correct and so forth and I can't remember the vote at that time I wasn't here but it seemed close it wasn't unanimous you seem close in there in their notice of appeal it does say that it was unanimous vote because the last time on this it looked close and that was only make sure we understand what it is

[01:04:00]
because I don't remember it being unanimous but it might have been maybe I'm remembering a previous vote I don't know was that a December 17th at the time I do remember my boat so anyway so then between that time and the time of the contract all of a sudden we have specials before period

[01:05:00]
I'm just

[01:06:00]
we have a hard enough time finding special education people you know much less one is an educator and a demonstrator and and all those all those things even though it's the right kind of criteria but you know when I talk to you before Robert about what criteria was you never mentioned that information and the idea that the special education is a major population in your group was really never mentioned and I think that's a critical thing you know when you got I think was 40% special

[01:07:00]
I credit you for working through having yourself in a position to do better that's what you should do but particularly if the appeal is is it confirmed or whatever I'm very concerned about the fact that if we keep going on with this appeal and so forth you're going to be two or three months maybe more in this school year and if all of a sudden it needs to be closed now the question is is well I'm a little concerned about closing it immediately I might say if it's going to be closed probably wouldn't be closed until school years or something because I don't want to be pulling kids out and try to figure out where they're going to go that's really not acceptable that's not acceptable so what is an adult

[01:08:00]
so I think again and I said if you go through this process we go through the pills we do all that and you guys continue to educate your kids but if you come down to the point of where at some point in time it's going to be a closer and I think our our contractors for a year is that the recommendation directions

[01:09:00]
play we we wait and see what the what the action really turns out to be if in fact the Secretary of Education decides in favor of the resolution and monsters to accept the contract then we in fact could accept the contract or we could not I guess we could go through revocation or whatever we want to do what's important decision but the point being is that if we go through all these apples and everything else and we eventually get to the point where it's supposed to close the school I would say we would not close the school because you're going to have at least two or three months of school maybe more probably at the end of the school year or something like that I don't know maybe that's something the board would make a decision on

[01:10:00]
in terms of the ideas of closure in terms of the the recommendation for keeping the kids educated in school and doing the things they're supposed to do and it may well be that we do see Improvement I mean you're going to be monitoring and in any case maybe we see enough Improvement maybe we see the leadership really does pan out I don't know what we're going to find you know so I think again to kind of pair a little bit of what she said some thoughts and some discussion about some of our supporters to go and see where it goes and even if the secretary were to come back and say agree with your your non-contract that doesn't mean the board can't make another decision where's the board have the opportunity to think about

[01:11:00]
particularly if the kids are already in school for whatever period of time it is right and even if it came back and said yeah we agree with your non-contract approval we still have to go through apparently the revocation process so that's another 45 month and a half so I guess kind of is a final to this discussion if if that's what the board thing is that we're in this process so we'll continue with the process and see where it goes if you come back and says 12:13

[01:12:00]
I'm not unanimous actually it was must have been 428 I was out of such a good question and yeah cuz I wasn't the policy meeting on the consent calendar it was 60% calendar

[01:13:00]
I appreciate that you're looking to corrective action and I suggest you go right ahead with that because if your kids are going to be there you definitely want to do what you can educate yourself

[01:14:00]
and whatever the secretary says relatives that appeal is what we will have to follow now if it comes back as they deny the fact that we have approved of disapproved the contract in other words they think that we ought to approve the contract and then we have to go back and say are we going to feel that are we going to agree to that or whatever if it comes back and says I agree with you bored you should in fact not accept the contract then in fact the next step is I understand it would be we would have to vote on replication I'm not sure why exactly this whole thing but let's just go through we would have to vote if we say we don't want to provoke what contract do we want to have that and we were still have to go through that project or if we say we want

[01:15:00]
then in fact they could appeal the revocation as well in the meantime our kids are going to school and so contract that we approved with the corrective action plan you're saying we could do something different we can expect something different absolutely so I think again we'll see how they appear works if we have a different information results

[01:16:00]
play really really good and they're doing really good progress maybe maybe that's another indicator for us I don't know if they got if we received anything from the PVC like anything at all we haven't as far as I know we haven't received anything yet I mean I don't know that information I just know that you said Mr President so when the public education commission was their authorizer we have requested for any authorizing or renewal with us coming from the state we asked them for any plans anything dot we have not been provided that for two years we have improved our process so that we have put the

[01:17:00]
responsibility on the school so that we are asking the school to provide us that those corrective action plans and if we were to obviously find out that there was a corrective action plan but the school didn't disclose that then we would bring that to you as a major concern and I would probably recommend revocation at that point but you know so stupid for how many years I don't know 10 years 11 years I don't know it's so Mr President I don't have the his total history but the school was authorized original by Albuquerque Public Schools and then it went to the public education from the PEC they have to have something well I

[01:18:00]
I thought maybe your question was is relative to the appeal do we have anything back from the public education department relatively appeal and as far as I know relative to that question I guess we do not yet is that correct if Mr President members of the board just last week we received a letter from the secretary who said that the basis for the appeal was not in sync with the statutes and the regulation we did and I I want you to know we meaning the attorney for the secretary that would be a board meeting and depending on the outcome of that it was entirely possible that there would

[01:19:00]
longer be a need for the appeal the secretary has said I will do nothing in terms of briefing until I hear from the action of the two boards and at that time I'll decide what I'm going to do so so you know and so the two lawyers have said if there's a path forward I would rather not spend time and money well we don't have anything different right now the only the only thing that can happen quite frankly is the board itself can schedule a meeting and can take whatever action they want including

[01:20:00]
approving the contract putting them on additional probation or whatever you want to call it so at this meeting this was an information information item and that's why I wanted in response to let you know the secretary is holding in advance any action on this matter until this board and there is Alana board take action see now that's a very interesting piece of information that I'm sorry was not presented to us earlier you know I mean not would have been a first thing I would have said is that here's the status of the appeal therefore we would have known what in the world is going on you know so thank you I appreciate it finally getting to that point so what you told me is that some for some reason the secretary says this doesn't agree with statute or something whatever he thinks and I don't even have an idea what he's talking about there I mean what

[01:21:00]
what do we mean by that you know what part of the statute isn't isn't being done correctly so I guess what you're saying is whatever the appeal is the secretary doesn't think that satisfied whatever the statute requirement is for an appeal is that what you're telling me Mr President board members yes and on the very first page of the appeal the notice of appeal by the lawyer for Loretta she says I'm appealing on behalf of based on Section 2289 in the footnote she says I found no regulation with regard to 22899

[01:22:00]
needs to be clarified in a future legislative session so at this point I think Joseph's statement is an accurate one which is we are in a bit of a grey area between two statutes I'm pretty confident that what's going to happen is that the school will remain open until the secretary makes a decision if there's an appeal and if there is a future agreement based on the board action the appeal will be withdrawn and I've had that Assurance from the president of the charter school calendar

[01:23:00]
I have an item sometime in the future and a board meeting or whatever with an action to do something differently that's where we are you know so are there other comments that how long can the secretary wait then I thought that was there a time limit for the appeals 3:45

[01:24:00]
and maybe at some point in time they'll make a better legislative rule about how this all out of work I don't know you know but again I recommend for a lot of Alana to make sure that you're educating your kids and make sure that you're doing the right things and we'll see where it goes but if it goes too far into the school year it's my opinion that we would not and again but my opinion is that it would be just a little dangerous for our kids to try to pull them out and whatever particularly if you've got a large number of special education kids they don't do well to move out of any kind of environment and do something like that so it looks like to me that based on all the appeals and everything else is adults

[01:25:00]
do that the school is probably going to have to stay open for a year before we can get everything all resolved if that's what the board feels even if they came back with closer so that's opinion here and again we'll just have to wait and see what happens and then the board can make profit decisions so may I make a suggestion here that we asked that the school and charter school office report to us on a monthly basis the progress on the items that we identified that were challenging that we we get to follow this rather closely with the secretary takes action or not it's kind of relevant but kind of not I mean what we want is in the best interest of these children and these parents and families as a school Community but we want to make sure that we're one complying with federal law

[01:26:00]
stop the corrections that we pointed out that must be made to be satisfied with his school are adhered to and I think you are very clear that people are not just forgetting to fill out the paperwork which is I think the excuse we got from the school principal but that we actually have staff who are actually following and making sure that the IEPs are being followed and all the details are being taken care of for these special ed students if we are a chartering Authority strikes me that that's our responsibility and if that's not happening I want to know about it before we get to the end of the year I want to be able to say no this isn't working what's a corrective action plan for our corrective action plan so it's clearly does documented because otherwise it just looks to me like we're made out to be fools as a boy goes and

[01:27:00]
play that we get to get some feedback in terms of where everybody is okay so I'm going to close this off just one little tangential thing that's not directly having to do with this but just I want to thank you and Miss Elder they represented a PS very well in front of the LSC earlier so they blew in I mean their hair was blowing in the wind because they ran in here after racing down from Santa Fe thank you for doing that and saying professional and collected all the time thank you for coming with us I appreciate that very much I just want to make sure 11 it talked about that we didn't we didn't vote on any revocation because it had said something about us you know about violating the New Mexico

[01:28:00]
absolutely we have ever tried it yet but

[01:29:00]
we worked for the Communications office to really put forth a communication plan it's on our website I believe we have Billboards radio School messenger so we're working on trying to get the message out to everyone and tonight you will see a quick demonstration and then we will come back a little bit before the beginning of the school year in policy just to give you an update on how it's been going good evening thank you very much for the opportunity to give you a short demonstration on the Synergy online registration system handles the registration of both returning and new students the goals for the implementation of the ridge of online registration to provide parents and Guardians with an online method for Reg

[01:30:00]
bring their students to get enrollments and registration data into Synergy faster and three save time and money for the school's eliminating manual data entry from paper registration Cards into Synergy that you have in your registration packet in front of you online registration was activated on March 1st for the 2018-2019 school year and made available for all schools to use training and best practices were also made available so that the schools would know how to process the electronic registrations parents started submitting the online registration has been generally accepted well by the schools and parents the system has presented some new challenges for the schools and parents while there have been some glitches we are also addressing them as quickly as possible so at this time I'd like to turn it over to Duke Garcia the Project Lead for online registration to begin the demonstration Judy system administrator and it's done a phenomenal job of implementing this module the entire student Information Systems Department

[01:31:00]
of this important new functionality and I could not be prouder of them we also need to acknowledge the contributions and support provided by the aps Communications Department in developing a community communication strategy and updates to the aps website as well as the technology department for making computers available and providing support to the schools for olr last but not least we need to acknowledge the Dr Bowman support in the successful implementation of the module Mr Garcia Andy thank you president of the board thank you for allowing me to do a brief demonstration this evening for you for the online registration also known as parent view I'm going to go ahead and access the login here and I am logging in as an existing parent what's really nice about the system at any time if the parent did get in erupted or left the computer had to go you know

[01:32:00]
on the stove you know pause for their commercials whatever it may be they can easily log back in and resume right where they left off for the demo purposes this evening I am going to go ahead and start over it will confirm for the parent the school year that they are registering for which is the 1819 school year and I'm going to go ahead and zoom in here a little bit once the introduction comes up it does the parent on what to expect as they go through the process indicating red asteroids obviously it's required and information requiring returning students such as the annual verification of The Residency along with immunization cards proof of address custodial any updated documents for the upcoming school year parents of new students we do require a number of documents but everything is laid out here and parents can easily make sure that they have some of

[01:33:00]
those documents as they move forward to continue the process let me zoom in up here what's really nice about the system is it allows the family to build out the family which is the physical address of the residents after that allows them to build out the parents and Guardians that live at that address along with building out the emergency contacts before they even get to their students typically it's the same information for all students part of that family but they can still put in if it is different and then they have the ability to upload documents and then review what they have changed and submitted right there click of a button this is the first time we're collecting electronic signatures of parents can I ask you a quick question is it pre-populated if you already have a student in the system yes that is correct

[01:34:00]
yes here is just confirming the family what is the physical home address if the parent has changed in address they can easily type that in it easily starts to populate that address registers that address within the system and it allows the parent to proceed if it's different from the physical address receiving the mailing address the parent can let us know that this is confirming the demographics for the first parenting guardian of the parent that logged in confirming their information and the address again the mailing address also work information some of the information that we do collect regarding our federal military and if the app

[01:35:00]
let's work on federal employment parents can easily fill that information in we always had to collect it by paper and update any phone numbers or they can easily delete phone numbers and add new phone numbers along with updating their email addresses the annual information for online registration after that they will log into their parent view account and submit those changes someone in the main office is accepting those changes and convenient to the system this is where list all the parents and Guardians that are part of that family they can go in and edit that information and if parents have different separate addresses it's not even listed here this is where they can easily come in and

[01:36:00]
play any emergency contacts remove emergency contacts or add additional emergency contacts again for for their students and as we can see their registration for their 9th grader for Albuquerque High School in this case it is in progress of the parents do have to come in here and click the edit button or the in progress all students have to be completed to submit the registration parents can easily come in here and put check marks if information does not pertain or in this case Vincent a third grader doesn't have a private email address this is a race of echo questions or Hispanic Latino indicator along with our race with the federal government

[01:37:00]
if they do relate to a tribal Community a tribal affiliation regarding our forms for the 506 and cib's click of a button a parent can download that information and they would like additional information it just directs them to the Indian education department for further information it also explains you know these forms that come from the Department of interior and the Department of Education at the federal Level Health Information parents can choose to enter in healthcare provider information preferred Hospital along with dental information this is kind of those blue cards you might be familiar with that or housing in the health office information such as

[01:38:00]
if there's EpiPen prescriptions hearing aid devices glasses wearing contacts or even a question that are Medicaid office has does your family need help signing up for free health insurance that gets notified to the Medicaid office to where they can easily go out and help that family get qualified parents can also provide us medications whether it be taken at home or their taken during the school day again this was a form that was collected by paperwork collecting a lot of information for the nurses back at the school site also hear it does let parents know their immunization status if this student was non-compliance in any of the categories it would be highlighted here to where the parent would easily oh you know that might be a red flag during the registration when we go in to get a schedule of classes or The Home Room teacher assignment is that part coordinated

[01:39:00]
is NM says with the the immunization system or is this reliant on the parent submitting it in this case the parents would submit their or we would make a copy of the immunization card if they uploaded it the nursing services department or the nurses would be entering in those States some release of information with authorization to use the internet we do have our exclusions providing information directory information out to the military businesses in universities parents can easily opt out of that by putting these check boxes but I did notice if you do not feel that portion of the application it's automatically it automatically says yes that information may be

[01:40:00]
provided to the military is that correct yes yes that is correct period

[01:41:00]
same thing for emergency contacts so we want the parent to relate who are these adults and how they relate back to the student and they also can be released to in case of an emergency I know how both students in green here the parent can save and continue the parent can and if they choose to upload documents they can easily browse their computer and upload any of those documents or they can easily handle your copies and set of uploading them but we definitely provide a number of those documents on that they can be uploaded electronically this is where the parent can click the review to see the entire process of the registration anything that they have changed it would be easily highlighted for them very similar to how the main office reviews the Reg

[01:42:00]
restoration and process it will highlight any changes that the parent has a has entered into the system I'm very easily to review that to where if there is a very minor changes for emergency contacts we we can safely except that registration if there's lots of changes we might you know spend a little more time reviewing that excuse me at this point in time is satisfied with what they have filled out they would submit the registration and in this case it was registrations would pop into Reginald's registration queue and Albuquerque High for the for the two students but thank you for allowing me to to do a brief demonstration of the online registration system and we're very excited moving forward with it in Spanish we have different languages

[01:43:00]
how do you how do you how do you gather electronic signatures for parents how do you do that if a parent doesn't know how to do that how would you do that I noticed you said that you yeah yeah it does very much exactly the same it's exactly the same okay so then my questions are so when you're looking at Hispanic and Latino so the first one where it says Hispanic Latino do they just write yes or no is there a yes or no

[01:44:00]
drop down of Hispanic music Hispanic non-hispanic and then again it'll say please indicate if you are a Hispanic Origins it's kind of like asking kind of the same question again so there is that yes or no the drop down in in the online registration system indicates just Hispanic and non-hispanic for that indicator so again so can you just tell me why you're doing that two times out what you see here is a form that has been pretty much exactly pretty much in the same format for almost home there are some things on the form and kind of as we try to translate it into the technological format

[01:45:00]
that aren't exactly the same and then there's also some things and one of these came up a little earlier that might be deprecated you know there was the mission in policing instruction about birth country so we it's been there for 20 years so we kind of copy this to the best of our ability but we absolutely are going to be reviewing this experience for the next year's registration to try to constantly improve it this is such a huge lift to change this into that that we couldn't we limited our scope to kind of replicating just what is in this one as your pointing out we don't ask the Hispanic Latino and so then the birth country so I didn't know why that was important but maybe it is important and I just don't

[01:46:00]
the importance myself then the other one is when you are saying indicate change so you asked for a primary race and a secondary race and then you're saying indicate change by using numbers 1 to 5 Below shouldn't say as I mean I just can see some people thinking they have to put one two three four five because that's basically what it's saying and so to me that's kind of confusing cuz I would be I would read it literally and go I have to try to figure out how much of whatever all of these I am and number five is the least that I am by my DNA you know so that's just confusing so that's another concern I don't know what people will do maybe they won't take it literally like like I would take it so that's just a question and then I know that that you had said

[01:47:00]
that there are some challenges and some glitches and you're trying to be proactive instead of reactive but I think we kind of have to be a little reactive so can you tell me what you've seen as some of the challenges and glitches and how you're trying to be proactive one of them is a parent having an email address you know in order to have a parent view account I'm a parent has to have an email address introducing an email address to a parent that you know me say what is that or I don't have an email address and introducing them to services such as Google opening up computer labs so definitely that was something that we wanted to make sure that you know hey we wanted to support those parents to where we open up those computer labs or be late in the evening out there local school come on in and we take the time to take care of that now rather than later on

[01:48:00]
I didn't registration hey we need to put you we were trying to take care of that back in March April and May to to kind of assist with opening schools now in August so that was just one of of the things that was identified and also another thing is family is not having access to computers possibly at home to do this in the comfort of their own home opening up again the computer labs and we're still talking open up computer labs here centrally possibly for the for next school year again just trying to make it available for parents to be able to assist them if for that one on one and so there isn't it is there anything here that they have to fill out that won't allow them to continue you know how there's things you have to do and it won't let you go next if you have something else for the required for some of those required fields and it will politely let the parents know hey this is a

[01:49:00]
Garfield okay and then the only other concern I have is when they're filling out the little the health form that they always a little blue form they always have to fill out that went to the nurse's office so when this is on a computer I mean that's really protected because that should be very protective so I just want to make sure that it is that is correct we partner with nursing services department since we've implemented Cinergy 5 years ago so yes definitely that was a big concern of theirs as well I mean we have addressed in his safely secured for the nurses to only have access to this information okay thank you thank you but because you are collecting protected health information does it mean that they can only access it at certain points so like what a library not be a good Outreach point

[01:50:00]
and you know in that case the parent is logging in in a computer sitting in the library logged into their with their username and passwords kind of thing I guess we would want to make sure part of our best practices as you know no one's hovering over the parent you know kind of I have been out to evening events I was out at 7:00 Elementary School back in April and sure enough that I didn't witness any of that but parents seem to be in and out you know within 15 to 20 minutes for those parents then it you know chose not to do it in the comfort of their home or you know internet access to computer so like community library then what would be a good Outreach Point yes it could be potentially could also go to to work on this OK Google

[01:51:00]
how security how security you feel this system is you know knowing its online how security you feel this is this information is and I know it is covered by FERPA correct yes all of the information on here that is correct yes no I am I'm I'm I'm I'm very confident and just the whole APS Network system of protecting student information

[01:52:00]
what is the boxes on here are not numbered I mean maybe it's not on my system maybe it's up there but what I see in front of me is not so if you needed to do a student profile no names or anything can you use this information to do a student profile parent profile in the district can you actually use this data would you be using this information in that way what type of can you provide a little more ethnicity ethnicity the profile of the ethnicity in the district so are you talking about

[01:53:00]
General reports as long as you're not identifying individuals I think that's the point she's making what can I give a profile demographics for example of the district demographics of a school as long as you don't have only one student it's like that naked identify the students are not number so I was wondering if this information would you know if you could use it in a generic way generally into the system does actually get used both for our purposes internally and it also gets large amounts of it to the state for their reporting so OK Google

[01:54:00]
for parents for families that really and truly don't have access to computers and are uncomfortable on computers is there any other alternative yes yes we definitely still have as one of the best practices is our clipboards with with just how we've always done for the last 20 years is the registration paper right now go to the computer is it supposed to call pieces of information for each of their five children the question about Country Ford

[01:55:00]
but I was at an interesting Heritage Academy in May and definitely it was on a Saturday morning during their food basket distributions they had about 150 families there well sure enough apparently azan's were pulling the the parents out of line holding their place in line pulling them into a computer lab and actually getting the online registration system completed there at the end of May taking care again targeting those families that they know I'm definitely have a struggle completing this thank you thank you I love us do we still have to show up on the day of registration schedule of classes or or your teachers

[01:56:00]
play I appreciate that that we have the ability to do this online too so thank you it will definitely just keep getting better okay thank you thank you just a couple of questions so I'm prepared I show up at school to register my student what exactly is the action that you take at president basically just kind of like what the schools have always done is kind of that tree on that first Station review online registration if not they would be guided into an open computer online registration piece they would move on to the next station or if they don't want to complete paper

[01:57:00]
that's great and yeah and I did have the questions about access controls cuz there's a lot of interesting data that different groups of people might have access to so it's kind of more of a multi-axis control not just a blanket can you get in or can you not get in because nurses may be don't have to have information about other things they may have to have information about health different departments may have different information about different things that they need to have so do you have kind of a multi-layer of access controls or how does that really work I mean the parent can obviously get all the information directly so they must have full access control for their information so others but but

[01:58:00]
different access levels what what exactly Mr President absolutely so Synergy the Synergy system has a a highly sophisticated security model with rolls for different groups and so the nurses can see one set of information and other folks can't necessarily see what the nurses are seeing the school registrar can see things that the school secretary can't see for example teachers can see things differently is is control by the role that the access person is actually identity I mean you got what you have 1200

[01:59:00]
very interesting I think it's going to actually be you know as we get through this and obviously the first first year you'll be a test for you that's all he is is and there will be some glitches but yeah it's good good idea and I really think that's great and just to let you guys know too as part of this whole information stuff that Rich has been working on and I heard that I was but there's lots of good information so much but a lot of good demographic information a lot of good charts a lot of good

[02:00:00]
stuff so you might want to go there and kind of cruise around a little bit and see what you see in my email to you all I gave you a little more Direction how to get to the park stuff because I had to kind of look a little problem solving you know we adults should be able to do that but yeah it's a really good really good display of the trend of the testing and so forth and I gave Richard a couple of thoughts about you know different ways to display the information to for example when it says 0% in a particular category that doesn't necessarily mean there are no kids in that category it just means from point of view of round 0.005

[02:01:00]
you got to be careful with that too I guess but yeah there's a lot of good information in there and this is again just I think part of what you guys are doing and I really appreciate greatly that's what you're doing so be careful cuz when you see a lot of things you get ideas this bored bored is full of ideas so anyway we'll probably have suggestions for you so thank you anyway appreciate that very much so we'll go on Eminem dot six so I'm going to consider 78.2 first and that's the approval by the board of education for the board authorizes the superintendent excuse me schools and Burnley Boulevard

[02:02:00]
East area for what he's doing in RFK so I will entertain a motion to approve that and a second second second all in favor please say hi all opposed A couple of questions the difference between the closing closing closing date and the date of contribution because the appraisal according to to the IRS in Section 17170 House to must not be made earlier than 60 days before the date of contribution so whenever you have a donation of over a certain amount it has to follow those rules

[02:03:00]
if you look at the closing and number seven it says the closing shall be completed no later than 60 days after approval from the State Board of Finance so are we making sure that those dates are are working OK Google

[02:04:00]
so the other one is a 7 B dot 6 and 7.6 is the approval for purchase of The Benchmark materials from Benchmark education company that that was just confusing to me is that we had already voted to approve this at a different a different price so then they got a better a better deal so we of course want to have the better deal so I just want to make sure that that's clear in there since we already did have this up for a boat and that did pass so that that was just that was my concern about that one so you just wanted we didn't really need to vote on that again this because we already have so right now actually getting a better deal so I just kind of going to hold the one we voted on

[02:05:00]
before when it comes to the price for this one it is confusing to me I'm sorry I mean I'm not you know I'm not the most brilliant person but we have two votes saying we voted for this for this amount and now we're saying we're voting for this for this amount so which one really holds I don't know okay and you get a better price they're going to go with a better price on this because

[02:06:00]
open to Benchmark coming back to us and saying okay you promised to buy two of these know it doesn't first of all they have not actually submitted the the the the the the purchase and so until they do that the purchase is whatever it is that we have finally approved so if we have approved a lower amount then in reality they can't go to a higher amount because that's what we've proved here it's a lateral so I don't remember not to exceed a certain amount and so that it could go up to that amount but it could be less than that amount you know I'm just saying I mean I don't know these people

[02:07:00]
what

[02:08:00]
and that's all of the items with the exception of 8.2 B dot 6 and also beat up two which in fact is going to come back to us OK Google OK Google volume to the level of professionalism

[02:09:00]
what do you do and congratulations to Dr Bowman for another beautiful female in his life we're not the only ones so so congratulations people in the room but could somebody provide me a name to give to miss Yolanda and Nora for them to follow up with you so they know what to do now on thank you so much

[02:10:00]
thank you so much for all the wonderful work you do everyday it's good to hear that we have a lot of great work coming from the district and I see that everything else has been taken care of from the other side with the with her with Yolanda so you know one of the things that we do in our community on the west side we do a lot of planning on our community and one thing that we were doing this Thursday is making sure that our community is is safe and that we address issues regarding education and so we every year when we have we have our mayor and nothing's off the table we have a you know nothing's off the table we get to talk to him about whatever so we're meeting with mayor Kelly tomorrow at 7:00 and so if you have any burning questions you'd like to email me a good one between

[02:11:00]
now in 6:00 tomorrow I'd be happy to share that with him and stuff and those are the things that we do we do a lot of planning in our community and it started you know anything from crime to keeping our neighborhoods safe keeping our community going and stuff and one of the one of the issues that I will bring up of course will be the overcrowding of our schools and so I look forward to meeting and talking to the mayor very good thank you that's good news about progress that's being made I do want to just add that also in congratulations to the graduate schools and for the number of students that are enrolled in summer school I mean I always I always worry about

[02:12:00]
I don't worry about it but I am grateful that we have that opportunity for students that need to do that that there is something that makes it available for them to to continue the education for those that want to work through the summer so that that's great I did have an opportunity today to attend the event over at Harrison Middle School with Center video with his job the job fair I got to meet with the principal and the assistant principal their great job they were they did a wonderful job and they were so just write invested in there with the community so that was really awesome I was impressed with like the number of people that were there it was it was jam-packed the the gym was brought back a lot of memories I was remembering when I worked as a as a recreation leader when I was with the county when I was like 17 or 18 years old was like my first job it was at Harrison Middle School

[02:13:00]
congratulations to to all this you know to the staff that made that possible because it was a it was a great event I don't have any comments thank you for taking care of the situation number of parents that have some kind of criminal lots of times it's very much stuff and just and I know we've raised it before about making sure that that doesn't become a barrier to them being able to participate in school and volunteer and whatever way they're able to and at the same time knowing we need to make sure that we keep her kids

[02:14:00]
what's the need is for some kind of appeal process to to be spelled out so that if so that if parents aren't cleared with the background check at one level they do have a straightforward and and transparent ability to appeal so but thank you for taking care of the specific thing and they are able to get together and we are able to move forward with that sometimes we're not able to

[02:15:00]
I can't tell you how much I appreciate how hard people work and there are lots of lots of different things but one specific thing Mister do Faye I have to tell you I got to complain about two dying trees on one of the campuses of one of my schools I mentioned it to John after meeting and I am reluctant to tell him anything about years and I can say in

[02:16:00]
complete total honesty that my language was always professional and up until last Wednesday my language in my board rule has always been appropriate and on Wednesday it was not and I just want to apologize again to anyone who was offended by that you know I ran for this position because I care about what happens and sometimes it makes me maybe inappropriately passionate or heavy-handed but I hope that it's never taken without the respect that I hope that people never feel that it's giving without the respect and the appreciation that I really and truly have for people who work here so thank you thank you the when

[02:17:00]
I think it was Brian that was speaking about school security and that somebody hadn't got back to him if we can make sure that somebody does that I would appreciate it or put out there I mean we know our policies are mandatory or we wouldn't have them in policy so to just kind of put that put that out there when it comes to security so people do know what the policies are and what's working and what you know what our stuff is doing because I know they're evaluating all the schools and things are going in that are going to protect our children so we just need to make sure that everybody knows that so if someone could make sure and get back to him I'd appreciate it and I don't think he laughed too so I don't know okay and then the other thing I wanted to just let everyone know that I appreciate Barbara a whole lot because it was very magnanimous of her to apologize to

[02:18:00]
but she did Apologize privately and that takes a really special person to be able to do that and I just wanted to let everybody know that that's what I think of her and I appreciate what she did so thank you Barbara thank you just a couple of things I know that several of us in the board met with some of the carpenter folks work for solution folks we talked a little bit about to see if we can get a date for doing that and who is a little farther ahead and some of the CT stuff and then maybe a lot of folks and I know they're coming up with

[02:19:00]
