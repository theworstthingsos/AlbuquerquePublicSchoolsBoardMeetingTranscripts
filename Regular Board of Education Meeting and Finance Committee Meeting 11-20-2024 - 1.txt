[00:24:00]
only to have APS now include books with overt pornographic content in school libraries in our name it not only proves our critics correct but it is an insult to those of us in the lgbtqia community who live private and dignified lives let's use common sense and stop using lgbtqia inclusion as an excuse to provide children with pornographic content in schools thank you ma'am our next speaker is Katrina Garcia Spillman followed by Owen Brown you have one minute I am a board certified queer educator with APS a proud Union member and a safe Zone coordinator at Kit Carson Elementary School I want you all to imagine walking into your classroom and not and having to leave your identity at the door imagine never seen positive images of yourself in the classroom in books videos or in the news representation

[00:25:00]
matters everyone every day I serve lgbtqia plus families and students who deserve to see themselves in my curriculum Educators know that one trusted adult can be the difference between life and death for our lgbtqia plus students they need to be heard and seen it is important for all students to see diversity represented and celebrated every student should learn about the Excellence of the lgbtqia community a raise your of an entire group of people only leads to fear and hatred what are students need is love and compassion we do this by showing all families they are valued and that all names and pronouns are respected and the lgbtqi plus people do and have always existed if I'm sorry you've got over you got one last sentence if we are to truly value the success of all students all families and every child in public education has the right to representation thank you Katrina

[00:26:00]
let me change one thing okay once you begin speaking on you have one minute thank you hello my name is Owen I'm the proud parent of two APS students all students deserve to see themselves reflected in the books they read and the history they learn diverse books and inclusive curriculums provide each student with the mirrors and windows needed to see their Reflections as well as the real world as it exists outside of the classroom you understand different points of view and bring hope for a more understanding future books are foundational to our educational system their tools for understanding complex issues developing critical thinking skills and empathy if we take those books away we are depriving students of the ability to understand the complex and challenging issues booking diminishes the professionalism of all Librarians and APS Librarians are literal experts who spend their time searching for and engaging children with age appropriate literature to give Credence to the hysterics of the book Banning crowd denies our children the rights to

[00:27:00]
and diminishes the professionalism of all APS Librarians books are not the danger here ignorant people who attempt to dismantle our educational resources are thank you I'm sorry that was Owen or next speaker is Glenn Wellman followed by John I'm not going to get this right I'm going to that clothes thank you sir thank you again to denounce the harmful and anti-lgbtq rhetoric and the suppression of these materials in our schools again our school should be the place of conclusion respect and understanding for every student regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity the messages of hate discrimination and exclusion that accompanied the Banning or something of these materials only served to home all of our students

[00:28:00]
stop rhetoric literally kills kids for direct it is directly responsible for the high rates of suicide among our lgbtq students as a parent I have the responsibility and the right to guide my child's education including what they read by removing books from the curriculum or School libraries you're taking away my ability to make those choices for my children and that is a violation of my parental rights fanaticism does not end with Banning books this is where it begins all students have the right to feel safe seen and respected every student deserves to see themselves reflected in the books they read and the lessons they learned by eliminating these resources and then I have to stop you you've got over here a minute please finish thank you sir John you're up I got it right once I'm not going to try a second time you have one minute once you begin speaking sir this district has become the P Diddy of the American education system it's disgusting what you are allowing to

[00:29:00]
the children Pep Boys going to school wearing thongs and wearing crop tops this is unnecessary and unacceptable the nine realities of lgbtq here they go they're only two genders number two without heterosexuality homosexuality wouldn't exist number 3 gender is not fluid is frozen number four parents who support transitioning a minor are guilty of child abuse number 5 transgenderism is a mental disorder one that we pray for those individuals who experience that we seek for them to get help number 6 if you support perverted books being in schools you're either a pervert or an ally of perversion number seven sections nearly 20 years off the lifespan of a male trust the science number 8479 disagreeing with lgbtq practices doesn't equal hate it could be inclusion thank you

poor Lifestyles maybe everyone else can have it like people who think otherwise thank you sir thank you Jack Cheney followed by Karen Hostetler Hostetler check you'll have one minute once you begin speaking thank you Google for your time as a white system in Nevada so I'm not here but elsewhere I would have appreciate the opportunity to learn more about myself like I thought I should there are parts of my sexuality I didn't really understand until my late twenties if I had the chance I wish I could have figured out sooner that's why I believe any ban on books in lgbtq plus content is not only misdirected the harmful for our kids as we continue moving forward in this

[00:31:00]
we already have people who are poorly educated you as history people who are denying the reality of racism and sexism both in the past and present and the strange fixation on things being woke when all anyone is trying to show is empathy and at minimum tolerance Banning any of the books discussed tonight will continue us down this Rabbit Hole of heat ignorance and fear both with others and ourselves and that's why I decided to speak tonight thank you thanks sir appreciate you Karen Hostetler your next followed by Christina Herrera first you have one minute once you begin speaking my name is Karen Hostetler I'm in Albuquerque rested now but I spent most of the last decade working as a children's librarian in Nebraska one thing I've seen a lot in meetings like this is someone else stand up and start reading extra from books that are available as optional reading for high schoolers they have some cussing or sexual terms in them they'll read these extra kids are in the room but read them of high schoolers in the room he didn't choose to read that book this bills awkward wrong for everyone because it

[00:32:00]
I hope that you'll pin that feeling from their bad behavior on the books and agree that they're bad books but your teachers and media specialist aren't out there reading below the third graders they're making books that are age relevant available to the relevant ages they're inspiring a love of reading and understanding about our world please protect your staff and the diversity of students they serve they stay strong against Reckless censorship thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Christina Herrera first hello I've been teaching High School in Albuquerque for 16 years as an introverted middle school kids with kid without any friends the school library was my refuge I remember this really the feeling of safety and belonging I thought their books open my eyes to history I didn't know allowed me to walk in the shoes of people with lives different than my own and recognize our shared Humanity with every book my world and my perspective expanded books are in a window where we see ourselves reflected and into the lives of others

[00:33:00]
books make us feel less alone in our experiences my lgbtq plus students have the right to see themselves reflected in literature Princeton psychologist Diana Tammy sunrises previous research that suggests that readers make good citizens because reading May to empathize with and understand the thoughts and feelings of other people today Pastor John quoted Proverbs 22:6 to train up children in the way that they should go so that they can continue in their old age as I teach and prepare my students in a democracy my greatest hope is that they've learned how to be empathetic individuals who can make their own informed decisions and fiction helps get us there thank you for supporting our kids to be thank you thank you Christina our next speaker is on Zoom it is Leslie Velasquez a coaster I'm attempting to get her in the room Leslie are you there hello thank you for having me

is our number one priority my name is Ashley Box stands and I'm a teacher at an APS Charter School regardless of what side of this conflict you are on the safety of our children is the most important factor the rhetoric that is being spread tonight by the Legacy group is encouraging to segregation encouraging divisiveness within our children if books could make us anything we want them to make us kind we want to make them make us respectful we want to make them encouraging we want them to be a celebration of our differences not a point to divide us censorship is not our job Banning books Longs in society of control North Korea Cuba Nazi Germany the signs

[00:51:00]
trouble in our in our political and social environment all started with Banning books in one small sentence please I made a promise to one of my students last week and I said in the light of this election I would keep them safe and I would do what I can and so I'm here to stand before you thank you Jason Stewart your next speaker followed by Raquel Padilla where is non-binary gender identity and like other cultures and identities these gender-related ones are not being forced upon students by woke teachers and walk by the way means simply supporting the notion that all humans are fully human and deserve equal protection under the law I've worked as an educator for many years and I'm an APS parent I've had queer and trans student struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts and actions some I could not

[00:52:00]
listen to the bathroom alone or let them use scissors unattended when kids are not represented in media and school curricula because they are singled out as not normal they are stripped of the validation and support they need to acquire the knowledge skills and capacities that we strive to teach them representation matters sadly hatred matters too do not let hate be a guiding value and determining what our students can read thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Raquel Padilla followed by Sarah Davis one minute when she begins in third grade my son's library in red Julian is a mermaid a book about a boy who wants to be a little girl the fact that this teacher thought that it was okay to read this book out loud blows my mind it was not appropriate and it placed a wedge between myself and my son in the following days my son had a hard time understanding why was so upset with the school because he didn't understand the wrong doing his teacher had done after

[00:53:00]
I no longer viewed my relationship with the school as a partnership but as a threat to my family's religious beliefs it took lots of conversation and time to undo all that that librarian had done in just one day and then I realized that exposure that the first exposure is probably the most important exposure to certain ideas and I was not going to let this school introduce topics that we as a family do not agree with APS should partner with families to educate kids and reading and math not working against them pushing against pushing their liberal ideas through literature that was done to my son to assume that everybody agrees with you is naive and wrong thank you our next speaker is Sara Evans town I believe and after that will be Jewels Myers you have one minute I have the pastor at Church of the Good Shepherd here in Albuquerque and I'm also the parent of two APS grad

[00:54:00]
I'm not going to speak to the folks saying that they're here to protect kids from certain kinds of literature we all know they're not here to protect all kids especially trans kids it's up to you to stand up to them and to stand up to them decisively because if you don't it'll be at the cost of kids lives kids that you chose to let me further isolated and bullied and erased and we is clergy people will be the ones who have to sit with the parents of kids who have taken their own lives and I just don't think I could do that can you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Jules Myers followed by Eileen Matic you have one minute once you begin speaking hello my name is Jules Myers I am a born and raised in New Mexico who graduated from Rio Rancho High School in 2011 I brought these

[00:55:00]
books for my personal bookshelf to share with you these books are books I rented from my high school library many years ago and have since bought and have carried with me for years these books have been with me for over 15 years and saved my life as a young member of the lgbtq community they were my lifeline and a time before a marriage equality before the lgbtq stores were talked about and what are media and before I was able to safely come out to my friends and family they gave me a sense of belonging a sense of Pride and a promise that I could one day be exactly who I am without shame taking books like these out of APs libraries will further alienate in already at First Community as members of the APS school board I would hope that you would agree with me that knowledge is power access to reading materials that are inclusive does not and will not hurt your students but taking away access to these books absolutely will I stand in front of you today and ask you to consider the lgbtq inclusion is more important than ever the students in your schools deserve to have

[00:56:00]
these books they deserve to have the access that I had 15 years ago period that's it thank you thank you Eileen medic you have one minute once you begin speaking followed by Courtney Lawton good evening I'd like to thank the board members and the superintendent for their belief that all students need to feel that they belong and are valued members of their school communities this is evidence by the creation and pursuit of Gulfport and guardrail for the results from this Falls Golf Course survey just came out yesterday shows that District wide only 38% of 86 students feel like they belong in their schools it's even lower at the high school level I've been in high school English teacher for 18 years and I've seen firsthand the need for students to see themselves their families and their

[00:57:00]
communities both in instructional materials and in library books are black Hispanic and Indigenous students Prosper when their Heritage and culture are part of the curriculum girls prosper in math when they see themselves in stem books and no differently are LGBT students will care about school when they see themselves in the curriculum and know that they too are entitled to grow up and create happiness for themselves thank you thank you our next speaker is coordinator hi my name is Courtney and I'm an English teacher at El Dorado High School I'm here to advocate for my students in their academic freedom and and to denounce the tactics and motives of John and glue a professional agitator my students deserve to see themselves reflected and represented in school curricula and

[00:58:00]
materials there's absolutely no harm in showing students a variety of family structures romantic relationships and interpersonal conflicts through fiction and nonfiction particularly when students might never talk frankly outside of school with somebody who is different from them what John and his allies are engaging in is something called stochastic terrorism dehumanize and vilify lgbtq people with the hopes of increasing the likelihood that other people will violently attack them John is exposing one of our strongest and most complicated emotions discussed I don't view my students with disgust and neither should you you are elected school board and we are counting on you to stand up for kids and keep them safe up very quickly in a short sentence at basically if literature could make people straight I've read a lot of Victorian

[00:59:00]
and I'm not swinging around on Moors marrying toxic men I am a lesbian thank you our next speaker our next speaker is on Zoom Amy Moore has I believe you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening thank you for your work on the board and the opportunity to speak tonight my name is Amy Marie I've lived in Albuquerque for 20 years the past 15 of them my kids have gone to 8 PS Public Schools I'm also a pediatric nurse practitioner and I've dedicated my career to caring for children in New Mexico our children have the right to access materials that teach them about themselves as well as different points of view and experiences this is the foundation of empathy restricting access to books based on topics of vocal minority finds objectionable is harmful to our students and community and has no place in our schools that serve our beautiful and diverse students School base support in

[01:00:00]
gay and transgender kids have been shown in multiple peer-reviewed studies to provide a protective effect on the mental health and well-being of children I have trusted my children in the care of APs Educators and I have zero reason to believe any intervention designed to limit the access to books with ideas that this group opposes will be anything but harmful to our children and our community thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Sarah Jane Allen followed by Eliza Eliza the hill you have one minute once you begin my name is Sarah Jane Allen I'm a wife mother and a small business owner with my husband All My Children attended to Double Eagle Elementary School of which I served for four years as the PTA president or vice president last spring while doing something for the election I spoke with an amazing mother that lived just down the road from Double Eagle she was the school nurse before she left she was

[01:01:00]
even an ultimatum in order for her to get a safe Zone sign outside her office she was required to sign a contract the school counselor had drafted in it she couldn't share any information or the decisions a student made at school with their parents every teacher and administrator at this Elementary School had to sign this contract to get a sign the nurse expressed how she felt serious intimidation and a level of hostility she believed as I do that parents need to be a part of a student's education policy parents rights and responsibilities this school board passed in 22 did as well but obviously no longer has marriage license our next speaker is a list of vehicle I started that too early

[01:02:00]
good evening members of the Board of Education and all others present my name is Julian Leonard and I'm representing Alyssa vigil I'm a student at Albuquerque High School and a trans person it is important to have a young voice one of the only Young Voices in this room here to represent the concerns of the community as a whole these concerns are related to the proposed removal of the of lgbtq plus literature from school libraries and the general treatment of lgbtq plus students exclusion is a form of hatred and the last thing a school district should be telling any of its students is that they don't matter by Banning media that share their story outing students when it could be dangerous for them and limiting and limiting accepting spaces that is the message you would convey starting with one minority group that is particularly vulnerable in misunderstood first doing this will be in direct violation of APs guard rails number 3 and 5

[01:03:00]
furthermore lgbtq plus books are removed if lgbtq plus books are removed I fear that books discussing other vital topics like disabilities and our racial identity I'm sorry I have to stop you please wrap it up in a very quick short sentence thank you for your consideration and time trans rights thank you our next speaker is Amy Harrison you have one minute hello my name is Amy Harrison I'm a former APS Middle School teacher and a parent of two children who have or and are currently attending school in APS and like many other people here tonight I'm really concerned about a push by anyone but certainly political groups to be in certain materials in our schools really

[01:04:00]
any materials in our schools and this is why I trust our Librarians to vet books and other reading materials for students and I trust our educator and our school counselors to choose appropriate relevant and representative materials for classroom use representation for students is a very effective way to gain engagement and Inspire critical thinking and for a marginalized student resonating with a character in a novel or the work of an artist can be a bright light and darkness even for very young students seeing themselves in the story and characters of picture books build self-esteem and a sense of belonging we've heard a lot about representation tonight but really all are students of all ages benefit from understanding the best and amazing diversity of The Human Experience and empathy for people whose lives might be very different from their own

[01:05:00]
you've been over a minute I need you to wrap it up very quickly please these are qualities we want and need for our future Educators or future parents and our leaders write thank you thank you thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Simona Muniz are you there yes one minute won't you began speaking please I am see Moana and I am an Educator's learning books negatively affects teaching history by eliminating necessary Voices From the Past Banning books will lead to students not feeling a sense of belonging in the classroom negatively affecting engagement and births leads to more dangerous policies such as eliminating certain groups from the school certain groups such as black student union peer helpers in the members of GSA this is literally a life and death

[01:06:00]
directions to hold on continue please sorry this is literally a life and death situation 22% of high school students reported having seriously considered suicide in the past and 45% of those are the lgbtq youth when you take away representation of black brown native and lgbtq youth you have validate their feelings and existence if you care about life in the youth living you'll allow these books and groups to continue if you care about protecting our students you will deny the repression of students of color of Youth and lgbtq if you care about preserving life you allow groups such as BSU GSA pure helpers to continue I care about their students I've got to stop you please wrap it up in one very quick sentence I care about our students I want them to live thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Diana Steely Dan are you there yes I'm here go ahead you have one minute okay

[01:07:00]
to the board for your service and for the opportunity to speak I'm Diana and Albuquerque resident and former Library worker educator I believe it is crucial to Foster and inclusive and supportive environment for all students in APS schools Banning or moving books that address lived experiences of lgbtq plus people whether they are similar to or different from students owns restrict students opportunities to grow empathize and engage with the complexities of the world around them the Albuquerque Community will not allow extremists political and or religious groups to strip away age appropriate educational content that promotes safety inclusion and belonging as a queer person raise in a household and Community where lgbtq plus experiences were suppressed or demonizing conversation and literature I understand how the lack of support outside my home hindered my ability to thrive as a child and have compassion for my peers if I continue to honor and uplift diverse

[01:08:00]
experiences we paved the way for a stronger future for everyone thank you our next speaker is Kathy gamble here in the Room Cafe you have two or one minute once you begin speaking hi my name is Kathy gamble I've been a teacher for 25 years and I'm here to speak on behalf of our students we're here tonight talking about representation specifically whose life is worthy of being represented in schools and we all know that representation matters we learn our own worth and we see the value in others through representation representation saves lives so I also want to address the kids that were talking about if you're hearing a message that your life is less valuable because your part of the lgbtq lgbtq plus community

[01:09:00]
I have a message for you and I hope that APS and the Board of Education will share that message each life has its place every one of us your life is valuable no one else has your thoughts experiences and perspectives you are unique and special and the world needs you specifically don't give up school board I hope that our books will send the same message to our students thank you our next speaker is online I'm sorry Jennifer English Jennifer are you there yes can you hear me yes I can you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you good evening my name is Jennifer English and I am coming here tonight as a teacher a mother and a Community member I was fostered by a lesbian woman and today I've been married to my husband for 30 years we own a home raised two children and are what many would call the All-American family being surrounded by gay people

[01:10:00]
did not make me gay just as being raised by straight people doesn't make a gay person straight and let's face it reading about penguins does not make me a penguin learning about different people cultures and Lifestyles is called education not indoctrination the purpose of education is to develop and understanding of diverse ideas and perspectives where is indoctrination is instilling ideology without question or critical thinking in New Mexico we cherish our Rich history of diverse cultures and value peaceful coexistence we don't impose beliefs on our neighbors and our schools should reflect that openness not fear thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room and that is good evening members of the board my name is Sloan Adams and I work for Turning Point USA faith and I represent churches here in New Mexico not

[01:11:00]
tonight to condemn or to judge me to tell you that you're right your identity is important struggling with this is actually part of Being Human but these issues go deeper than pronouns are gender selection like having food stuck in your teeth while we may not like being told we appreciate someone telling us the truth when our self-image doesn't match reality I'm here because while children may feel that they are in the wrong body it is wrong to violate the parent-child relationship in a country where kids can get or rent cars it is wrong to allow them to access pornographic and sexual materials those who allow this I would urge you to remember it would be better for him or her if a millstone were hung around his neck and to be cast into the sea and the harm one of these little ones thank you

[01:12:00]
I am here all right thank you so much chair and members of the board I'm Mariana Anaya representative elected for New Mexico house district 18 and a proud graduate of Valley High School the day after the election I hopped on a zoom and I spoke to high school students across the country specifically those who identified as women part of our lgbtq community immigrant Latino Community as well and it was really clear to me on this call that young people across the nation are really hearing for their existence and that is so because of eight black actions that really seek their Erasure like books period And I know that those are not the values of the sport either the proud she got a lesbian in the House of Representatives I'm here to reassure students that we have your back this session representative and I will post sponsor legislation in the house that assures that

[01:13:00]
will be accessible in our public schools and in our libraries so please pay no attention to the folks who threatened your access to education they may have gotten away with it in other states but here in New Mexico we protect one another thank you special education teacher I'm here to speak on why it's so important to a firm and support period

[01:14:00]
giving them hope so they can discover and confirm themselves so we can give them hope that they can have full lives but they can have Futures worth living as a queer trans educator myself I provided support and providing support the career students throughout my very long career providing them these days I've seen them private I've seen students who have given up on life get their energy back at their hope back and be the best they can be I like them my statement by noting today is the trans day of remembrance my community is morning 36 people lost this year some of them are used we can make this number 0 next year I mean the world to so so many thank you thank you and board members that concludes public forum great thank you Mr Gonzalez and thank you also to our public forum guests we will now proceed with our agenda which is moving to agenda item five student outcomes focused governance and specifically 5.1 discussion on student outcomes

[01:15:00]
and consider approval of implementation timeline are presenter for this agenda item is Miss Ashley pause our student outcomes coach with the Council of great City Schools as support materials board members also were provided a draft implementation timeline to support this discussion and as soon as she is settled I will turn it over to Ms Paws you have the floor

[01:16:00]
what is a funny song good to be with you tonight like that so I'm here to talk to you about your implementation timeline with Council of the great City Schools the implementation timeline is a document that is essentially a project plan that says and identifies the scope and the sequence of how the board will continue to implement the governance framework that you all have chosen as you are like where your so the current time that you have goes until the end of December however your contract with the great City Schools goes until February so the request was to go ahead and extend or extend the time line

[01:17:00]
February and talking to several of the board members they asked that we provide go ahead and stretch it out till the end of the summer so that should the board want to continue implementing the the framework you have a little bit of a Runway and a plan for you to be able to do it either with the support of the code if you decide to continue our agreement or having the ongoing support or where you can move on it with an episodic coaching support just in your membership as members of the Council of crazy schools so you'll have had the opportunity to review the implementation timeline the way that this was developed so we started with the existing timeline there were several items on that time line that were

[01:18:00]
they were still pending that maybe they had been pushed back so we went ahead and moved some of those so hold on to some of those items there were other items that came up through our one-on-one conversations that I and our other coaches had with you all and over the last several several weeks so that's how the items that are on the timeline came to be and also from your self-evaluation and that conversation and the items that you identified as wanting to wanting to be part of your upcoming priorities so with that background I know that you all have had the opportunity to ask a couple of questions which I believe our posted online for the community to see and I think you will have the opportunity to view those and you have the time line and I'm here

[01:19:00]
to open the floor to any questions or if there any or any specific pieces of the timeline that you would like to review together I'm happy to talk about any or all of it as you wish thank you Miss pause and I'm going to turn it over to secretary as daughter got to facilitate the discussion in person and call on board members as they have questions but the floor is open to questions and discussion can I just as a matter of protocol and can I move to approve the students focused governments implementation timeline so that we can then move to discussion so I moved to approve the student outcomes Focus governance implementation implementation timeline and I'll second this is supposed to be thank you we do have a motion from Member Jackson and a second from Member Dominguez and we will now transition to any discussion or questions and so as we're as y'all are thinking

[01:20:00]
there are a couple of items that I do want to point out so there are so there's one specific item if you'll look at into the month of June 2025 it has identified and paneling a committee to start round two of your policy diet so you all are just finishing the end of your first round of your policy diet so I the way of explained some of you I did not feel that I had the unilateral authority to not include that but it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you are literally just finishing the first round to start the second round in June so one of the recommendations that I have is that you so you don't have to there is no expectation for you to do around two of your policy diet you've done a lot of work

[01:21:00]
and so I think that that is safe to remove but that's also a decision for the board for you all to so I wanted to put that out there and also I wanted to acknowledge that there were a couple of members who identified a desire to move a little bit slower in this next year up until up until now your implementation has been very fast-paced so there are a couple items in the first couple of months and this is because we wanted to acknowledge the the timeline or so that your contract with the council does end in February of course you have the ability and we would love to continue that if you would like to roll it over but we wanted to be able to give you the flexibility to move to episodic support if that's what your desire is so we wanted to make sure that we were able to cover several of those items before you get to that point so that

[01:22:00]
you did have the flexibility to make that decision but I did want to acknowledge that and if that is the desire so if the desire of the board is to continue with ongoing support then we can absolutely kind of stretch some of those things out if we needed to thank you would you like to start the discussion I would but I'm a little bit I just need to check in you said that in January there's a line item in June 25th yes and so let me grab my notes and I have questions about beginning with an observations beginning with October and then

[01:23:00]
more questions in November and December but it struck me as I was going through the timeline that this is a request and in a topic just for consideration is it possible to Precious the timeline with an understanding that or statement that says the following and implementation schedule is designed to adapt to the changing needs of the aps Board of Education and a new Administration the timeline represents goals rather than firm deadlines so the timeline is the timeline is the agreement of the board that this is so it is essentially the board saying this is the work that we are going to do at the at the pace that we want to do it so this is the scope of the sequence of the work that the board wants to

[01:24:00]
over the next year so you know the your agreement with the with the council ends in February so that that portion of the timeline is is tied to the contract that we have together and so right now it's not it's your current timeline is in place so the one that is in the ends in December and that's what's tied to the current agreement but after so the expectation is that if there is a few make a couple of adaptations that's usually not a big not a big deal but if you get significantly significantly off track with any of the items or if there's something if there are several reports that end up getting kind of pushed down the road for whatever reason we do ask that the board come together and have a

[01:25:00]
station cuz that is it is important that you all through the word that you've made to one another and so if the plan changes the plan that you all have made and you all need to have the conversation together about what your expectations are for each other and how you were going to move forward as a board okay so remind me when did we as a board discuss this timeline I believe it was approved it was I don't have the other one in front of me but it was it was actually approved prior to the last renewal I want to say October 2023 and for the most part the board is is still on track for the most part with the with that current time there are a couple of items that are that are

[01:26:00]
y'all got y'all move somewhere up and you move somewhere back but it is still largely aligned with what you all have agreed and so that's an example of of the plan can change but when it's really when you have like significant differences when we would encourage you to come back and have a conversation together right okay so so it seems that a precedent is already been established where we we work through some minor adaptations so I'm going to weigh in then and agree that this I mean it's it's seems like a lot I didn't say that during the interviews but yeah and and so that's I'm just waiting on that yeah so this is an opportunity

[01:27:00]
for for you all to have a conversation I'm here to facilitate but really this is an opportunity for you all to have a conversation with each other as a board about how you want to continue this work and so if there are items that you feel or maybe extraneous or that are you know that everything that is on here is on here because someone on the board has said this is a priority for me so if there are things that you feel is a priority or is not a priority then definitely I think that this is the time to speak up so that you all can have that conversation but I am I am generally open to adopting this to how the board desires so make some like we got that cleared up so I'm suggesting one edit in November and it's a general it just in general and

[01:28:00]
I'm trying this out as a consideration I know that the council coaches are invested in the 50% of the board's monthly meanings of being yeah and so I'm offering as for consideration that rather than making it hard 50% because I'm looking at what we were able to accomplish this year and we're working we're working at a good clip and so if we look at what is happening this year there are moments when we've hit I don't know I think 38% but through no fault or lack of

[01:29:00]
on Administration side or our side right and so I'm offering that maybe we create a range of you know that we shoot we are in our infancy learning learning to walk with s o f g and so I'm offering a 35 to 50% range because I know this board puts a lot of stuff into that board self-evaluation and and it's it's important to get the points that are on that self-evaluation for many members so I'm just throwing that out there 35 to 50% as a arrange to measure our

[01:30:00]
our efforts toward progress monitoring that doesn't mean we back off the progress monitoring calendar but as we've seen this year it's often times we get off track for whatever reason again through no fault tomorrow so so hard to kind of readjust the the expectation to spend 50% of the boards monthly meeting minutes in your monthly bored authorized public meetings so your current threshold is you want to spend 50% of your time focused on student.com the proposal is to go to to make it more range between 35 or 5035 to 50% and my hearing that accurately what is the recipe

[01:31:00]
similar discussions of do we want to go hard do we want to kind of fall back a little bit but to the specific question about reducing the 50% and I you will not be surprising that we need to maintain our goal and the reason being is because what's what do we say what happens in the boardroom trickles down to the classroom I'm very concerned that if we lower our own expectations and say well maybe we can't quite get to 50% so we're going to lower it to two more of a range does that also then mean that when we start looking at the goals well maybe it's not a 10-point increase so let's just like move it back down to a range of maybe five to seven I think it's it sets a bad

[01:32:00]
president for what we're asking the district to do what we're asking the superintendent we're asking the teachers the staff that the students we set the school of at least 50% and 50% should absolutely be doable especially if we can work towards efficiencies and work towards keeping the focus where the focus needs to be so I would politely disagree and maintain that we need to keep the 50% not only that we've already said it as guard rail to for a board guard rail we've already agreed to this and I am always hesitant about agreeing to something and then backing down because we haven't met that it doesn't mean that we can't meet it it just means that we haven't yet and so for those reasons I would respectfully disagree and asked that we keep it up

[01:33:00]
I've got one one person for moving it to a range one for keeping it at 50% so thank you both for sharing what does everyone else think I remember thank you I'm trying to filter my words I think going backwards is a huge mistake like we were very thorough at the beginning and not even just throw but intentional about why we set this range I believe we're truly the ones that are setting the example as to why we needed to make the change and if we if we go back on our word and what we said we were going to do we're not modeling to behavior that is saying what we want change for the district and to put it bluntly where are some freaking smart women we know what

[01:34:00]
and again excuse my bluntness but I think it's a complete for me it's disrespectful thinking that we can't hold ourselves to this standard like we knew what we were getting into and I'll do respect I believe even new board members knew it because they got an orientation fully describing what the expectation was prior to even being elected and I think all seven of us again we're sharp we should be able to do this work and be able to hold ourselves to the standard not going back not compromising not giving us a way out because that really sets the tone for the whole district and takes us backwards and I personally believe that's completely the wrong woman just my opinion

[01:35:00]
I thank you so just to be clear because I got a little lost we are talking about investing at least 50% of the boards monthly minutes until the monitoring yes okay and if I am clear we have not met that yet have we we came up yeah I think 488 and if I'm calling correctly we've also done really important work that maybe wasn't exactly as well and we didn't get in trouble for not meeting the 50% we knew we were still doing good work we are smart people as board member of America says and we I think can accomplish this I am not really in favor of changing it because we haven't even met it yet and I think we can get there but I also think that

[01:36:00]
if this is not weaponized then it's an OK Google it's a goal we should keep if it's used to demean diminish slander board members about whether they're participating and doing the work or not but I'm not in favor of that so far I haven't seen that and I'm glad because that doesn't help students but I think we can keep it keep ourselves accountable and also remember that we're doing good work that might not exactly fit into that category thank you for going to comment on that one before you go because that you said something that was like I need to I need to say this no one is ever going to walk into this room

[01:37:00]
at least from my organization and say how dare you not get to 50% you know we have words that have been trying for years and years and years I mean y'all have been trying for years as well but you also have been hiring a superintendent and setting your goals and do it you've been doing a lot of important work this is really like the starting point now that you're superintendent is in place your goals are in place this is really where you can expect to see things start to stabilize so that you can sit in that 50% but at no point regardless of what you all decide tonight no one is going to come in I mean even if you set it at 75% which I'm not going to recommend that 50% is what's in the manual because that's what what evidence says is aligned with effective board behaviors for districts that are consistently improving student outcomes and so

[01:38:00]
no one is going to ever come in and say how dare you not get to that get not hit that goal so thank you for saying that I'm sorry thank you for that board member tell Marie too I know I do have some concerns especially when we're looking at 5050 it's one of the things I know when people talk about we're going to put ourselves behind but the thing about it is how far from those who do understand the process and are moving forward just keep going forward while some of us are still trying to figure out the parts and the other thing is when we throw out that it's our due responsibility we met prior to that I have to disagree with that that was not mentioned beginning about going into SOG and what our responsibilities were as a new board member so trying to catch up in all of these parts was one of the things in trying to figure out why is this going on

[01:39:00]
what's going on here but at the same time I do agree also with Heather because many times what's thrown out there is that you knew what you were getting into you know what your job was just do it and so that in particular in those words and and using this and and Ashley I know what you say and I know what you mean by saying nobody's going to do that but there are those underlying voices that do that when it comes to meeting these goals and the and the position of talking behind other people's backs on when we don't do these things and why we're not doing it and many times it's one of trying to address this in our personal matters and according to our governance manual that's very alarming when we when we can't figure out why we're not agreeing on terms are moving forward and it's and nobody wants to call these adult behaviors out because it's an

[01:40:00]
especially when I look at these synopsis and the support proposal there are some issues but moving forward also means we got to move forward in unity and in agreement but I've often felt that there are still some words about back fighting and going on where some of us have to just pull up and add to the responsibility or do your job and get moving so if we're going to do this we have to come in agreement that we are going to support one another and we're going to do it to the point that we understand that this is important so our kids can succeed but I'm in disagreement if we're not going to go to that space because what I'm saying is yes let's move forward and we're all going to agree but we're not willing to take care of our own actions when it comes to addressing some of these matters to one another so I will support but I will disagree because what I'm saying

[01:41:00]
what I see happening I question for the reason of yes we're going to be goal monitored we're going to pull forward and we're going to stay focused but not to the fact that we're leaving other board members behind and hoping that they're just going to catch up because they know they know what they signed up for that's what I meant disagreement for and if we're going to grade and put these particulars on board members and those of us who are trying to catch up you can't penalize us for that either so that's my space and that's what I'm going to continue to right now because I really want to move forward but I also know that space is provided for those who need to know the information in order to move forward thank you thank you I don't know if you have any comments no but thank you thank you for speaking your truth board member thank you president Gonzalez

[01:42:00]
thank you sorry I'm having a zoom challenges right now I wanted to do two things wanted to respond to member to morito but also to express my support for sticking with the 50% goal of having our board meetings focus on student outcomes for many of the reasons that have been stated already but also because that allows us for 50% of our time to be spent doing other things and half of our meeting time is a long time to spend doing other things so whatever that may be whether it's legally legal obligations or approving contracts or recognizing staff or whatever it may be I think we need to acknowledge that 50% is a long time to spend talking about things that are not related to student outcomes so I think for me I do feel that

[01:43:00]
percent is a good goal it's a bare minimum goal for me but also I think we need to acknowledge that we approved it as a board guardrail within policy and so this would not be the place where we could change it it would need to be changed in the context of changing policy or in the context of changing the governance manual that said I do want to acknowledge the comments around leaving people behind and feeling like this could be used in a punitive way that certainly not the intent and in fact that's exactly why we're having this conversation right now is to respond to the feedback that we've received from board members about Pace about flow of information about thorough understanding of student outcomes focused governance about how we got from where we started to hear and so that's why the council team did the one on one phone calls with everyone to really understand what are the concerns

[01:44:00]
about all of those things what are the concerns around what did or didn't happen during orientation what are the ongoing learning gaps and needs for us to fill individually and collectively as a goal as a board to be able to advance this work and so the changes that are in the implementation calendar are yes slow down yes extended yes more in depth on certain areas of the sfg framework that have already been covered for board members who have been here and we'll be recovered some components that are new but really just an effort to really try to do exactly what I hear everyone asking for which is making sure that we are all on the same page and so also just I know we'll get to the Slater but in the context of some of the questions and answers that were submitted in advance similarly in response to the request for more information more training we have scheduled or on the process of training an additional an additional sfg training for

[01:45:00]
and so that is the opportunity to take some of these lingering questions or misunderstandings and fill those gaps around how exactly we apply the Sophie framework in the context of Albuquerque Public Schools and so I just want to acknowledge that we have heard that there is concern about not having information we have heard that there is concern of not being fully on boarded we have heard that there is concern about Pace we have heard around the way that our focus on student outcomes has been felt or perceived sometimes to be me too blunt or two myopic or whatever word people want to use and we're trying to respond to all of that feedback in the context of recruiting this implementation calendar timeline but I think reducing our goals that we set for ourselves around how much time we are going to spend and I think reducing the goals that we've told the public we're going to hold ourselves accountable to would not be the Right Moves

[01:46:00]
thank you president Gonzalez from my comments I just want to go back to board remember the Mingus a suggestion about the 35% to 50% range and I believe the context for her mentioning that is because we know we might not make it this next quarter we're not going to make the 50% so I just wanted to kind of throw that out there and say that that is what I feel like your reasoning was which I agree with that I think most of us agree that we're probably not going to make that this time but as all the comments have been stated that's okay we know we know that that's happening so I'm okay with keeping the 50% but I also understand that we all take the self-evaluation seriously I don't want to make sure that we're hitting the marks that we have been hitting so yes I agree and then I also wanted to go back to something that board member told about the training that we got before being elected and just

[01:47:00]
because I want all of the board members to know we did not get a training before we were elected on what so if you was and how we should how we should be as board members so I think that's super important context because it is sometimes feeling like new board members are falling behind even when we're doing the work or trying to understand things so I I am in agreement in that way but I do believe that we could make the 50% once we work harder and I think this ties into my opinion on the next item which is like ad hoc committee is and time management and what that looks like and how we can make everything a little bit more concise but in this topic of 50% I agree that we can keep it at that great so I think we've heard from everyone and I also like to just acknowledge that this is a board of perfectionists and it's really hard to to lead a continuous Improvement framework would you

[01:48:00]
perfectionist because what I am also a perfectionist I want everything to be perfect right now but part of part of what this framework really does what I love about it is that it does encourage you to show that Grace in and not being perfect and even within within the implementation the goal for your implementation score is not 100% the goal is 80% and you can actually like that you can get there in many different ways so it's my job is your coach to constantly be pushing you because that's what coaches do but also there is a lot of great there is so much grace giving in this conversation and you are constantly being lifted up as really exemplars in this work so I definitely want to acknowledge

[01:49:00]
that and don't be so hard on yourselves about not getting the 50% you'll get there I promise that you have another suggestion before no I think I think that's right it's about giving Grace and about not getting so wrapped up in the attainment of points it's more about I think that they're different ways to be perfectionist and and it's not so much about the grade the top grade and in support of each other and that's critical without any kind of from the diet right so as long as we can agree to that

[01:50:00]
approach absolutely so it sounds like we're keeping the 50% on that one so I'm going to move on to board member Jackson if you have any comments or suggestions for discussion I do not have any I don't have anything that seems to that I would like to see change within this implementation guideline I think that you you Ashley and whoever helped you to put together I think the three of you and you took the opportunity to listen and to call all of us to really hear what it was that our concerns were and it does appear as though the concerns were reflected within this implementation calendar I always appreciate having a framework to work against I will

[01:51:00]
respectfully disagree but I think this is why this board maybe is a strong word it's because I do like points right that is my personality I do want an A+ I do want 100% I do want us to stick to you know what we said we were going to do that is me and I think that my personality that bringing that let's see bringing that aspect to the Dias helps your aspect helps your aspect we all helped we all bring something that collectively moves us forward and so I it's so funny I'm like how can you back I remember having this exact conversation when we implemented the first time line which was yes let's have something that we we we monitor ourselves against so that we don't flounder so that we're constantly working forward

[01:52:00]
and again so that we are modeling the behavior that we want to see from the superintendent and from the district and so I can I reserve maybe at a later point but I mean I've reviewed the implementation guideline and I appreciate your response to what you heard from all the board members thank you thank you thank you so much so my next question is in reference to December 2024 unity and Trust board received statements of interest from Individual board members who are interested in officer positions for the 2025 calendar year and I'm curious is this a usual usual practice at the board has engaged in over the years

[01:53:00]
what specific issues or objectives prompted the suggestion and how does it enhance the overall process so there was a request from a couple of board members that you all have opportunity to look at the way that you elect your officers and so there were actually several ideas kind of thrown around and so I don't we're not going to get into all of those ideas tonight cuz that's why it's slated here on this conversation to that would be part of the best part of one of the pieces on here but there were several board members who expressed a desire to really consider the way that you elect your officers and to make it a more transparent process that is more open

[01:54:00]
and really the eliminate some of the conflict that has been felt in the past I know that the times that I have observed the meetings that I have observed where you all have engaged in your what is it that you call it your board organization we just called the officer elections I don't know a single board that has just said let's just let's just all show up and make make motion on the diet that that day that doesn't have just like dread going into that meeting and then leave with like months of resentment afterwards and needing like almost a team building after that just to like have healing so there were some suggestions from some of your colleagues one of the suggestions was to to take some statements of Interest the at least if

[01:55:00]
if you all know a month in advance of who is who wants to serve in different roles different capacities that that would at least make it more make it more open and less like hence and we actually so within so from Council great City Schools we actually do have a support document and I actually left a stack of implementation guys on the on the diet there you go so there's actually a process of laid out in there you don't have to follow the process that that we recommend I like it because it makes it very objective and subjective I don't know it's just the politics out of it which is a recovering board member but I want you all to do I want you all to figure out what's going to work for you so if there were enough people who identified that as a need there will also

[01:56:00]
I'm a couple of other ideas thrown around about so there was a request to look at the way that like how you how officer terms overlap with Board elections and the way the officer officer serving when they're up for re-election again that's those are all conversations that you all have to you all have to decide what's going to work for you but if it's something it is something that was mentioned enough time that it is clearly something that you all have identified as an issue that you would like to move forward with so that was it's not usually something we put them in Plantation time line but it because it was mentioned enough time it was worth putting it in there so if we do agree to this because it doesn't state it and I don't know that anybody asked this question is there going to be a hard deadline and if somebody does not declare their interest by that deadline

[01:57:00]
and then they cannot run for office during that meeting I think that is a great conversation to have when you are evaluating your governance manual and the way part of your officer selection process it's up to you really but this really is something that I have no opinion on best practices but it is such a sensitive subject that I really want you all to figure out what's going to work best for you thank you I understand the wanting to know but I also understand if there are those who do you want to run on that day of election that should also be given because I didn't know I was

[01:58:00]
name for vice president till 20 minutes into the meeting and I ran because I didn't understand the process of Elections but I threw my name in the Hat so but if I were under those these restrictions I wouldn't have been able to do that so somewhere we have to have this leeway for incoming people those who may not understand the process or those who it might change to run but so yeah I think that if we're not strictly standing on these guidelines and also that we leave it open to those who want but then I don't know for defeating the purpose but I think that we have to give due diligence to those who made all of a sudden and decide on that day to want to run so anyway that's my feelings on the matter thank you can I can I ask for

[01:59:00]
question board member Tom Morita sure this is for everyone on the board to consider would you prefer to it rather than saying that the board is going is going to receive statements at this time would you all prefer to to to to to to to to Really set out like the board the board will identify a process for how for how officers are selected or for for how these statements of interest can be expressed so if I can respond to that so again we're trying to be I think this revised implementation calendar is trying to be responsive to feedback that we got from members of the board who said that coming into that first January organizational meeting was not enough time and not enough preparation around

[02:00:00]
for the officer positions and so this is an effort to try to respond to that concern and drawn from other Council great City Schools governance manuals and so partly in the context of updating our governance manual at the same time that we're proving our implementation calendar wanting to try to do both things at once and so I think her Ashley's suggestion we could certainly change the language to be something more along the lines of determine a process for improving officer selection in January organization meeting or something like that some of the other models that are and I think perhaps remember Domingos and member Jackson can speak to this as they were the ones on the ad hoc committee who reviewed other District government spaniels but some of the ones that I read that were shared with us last year had things like after the election happens then there's like a week of on

[02:01:00]
it's up to us and so we can decide How firm we want that to be we can say it's encouraged that you notify your peers and that you submit a statement by a state but not required but again we can that's entirely up to us and trying to create a process that's going to work for everyone while being responsive to both criticisms and concerns that we heard from folks as part of how the process has worked thus far the comments from the subject so I I actually really like this I like having like an interest in expressed a little bit earlier and because it really does

[02:02:00]
it's very contentious it's very like tense and uncomfortable and so it kind of gives each of us the opportunity to really think about what we're interested in what we want to do have the chance to review what each of those responsibilities are but I think that this is you know the way that this is laid out here this is just for now right this is just for what would happen coming in January for us who already know what the those positions are so I I wonder if it makes the way it's dated right now is kind of particular for January 2025 so I wonder if this could be amended slightly to add it to the governance manual so that even looking forward to next

[02:03:00]
November December when we possibly have new board members joining what process do we Implement for them to also have the ability to express interest that makes sense so I'm hearing you say I'm in the language so that we that we that you take statements of interest for this year for this year's officer organization and then in the in the review of the government's manual you actually Define process for how this board will move forward and in future years is that that's exactly the intent so if I wasn't clear when I was trying to explain that we're doing the implementation calendar and the governance manual at the same time so the intent is and that's why it says 2025 calendar year so for this year for this current

[02:04:00]
bored where people who are currently in the seats and it is at the end of December where we are looking to have a process for people to submit their interest in advance and we are also improving our government's manual and that's further on this implementation calendar I think it's in December when we approve those revisions and so revisions to how this process happens in the future with future boards and following an election would be included as updated in those manual and I'd like to also acknowledge something that I didn't acknowledge previously so there was also a request that you all consider moving it moving the decision to the currently you're doing it in the first meeting of the Year there was also a request that you in the future do it the second meeting of the year I believe that there is actually I think that it's in like your

[02:05:00]
code that it has to happen on the meeting in the Years where there are elections so y'all could move it this year but that kind of also defeats the purpose of the request because the request was like oh it's so hard as a new board member to come in and have to make that decision immediately I think your state law actually requires you to do it that way but I think that stuff is all it's something that they're also looking into so and that's part of the reason that it's not like this this conversation isn't necessarily the time to deliberate how it's going to be done but it is something like in the very very very very very near future like within the next few weeks so it feels right if it's going to be in the next few weeks so I think we need to have some Grace

[02:06:00]
these things so the the benefit I agree it cuts down on the awkwardness of the annual meeting it puts it puts our choices on the table before the meeting and we have a little bit more info going into the meeting before the vote the opposite or the calls if board members are talking with each other about the positions which I think you need to be able to talk I think it was with one another so there are several questions that we would have to answer what

[02:07:00]
will there be requirements about how this is done written interest parameters or rules around all that what can be shared transparency about how we come up with who who who who has input because I think it's it's super important that we all feel hurt and that we all feel like we are having a or influencing the process and will it be done simply during the meeting before the public lots of questions but I do see the benefit I have hesitant because it's it's so

[02:08:00]
late in the game this should have started sooner but I think there's a way to navigate through through the process as long as you know we're not stringent at this moment on the timer I mean the timeline is the time line is what it is just because you have a your meeting has to happen and like that first first week in January so that's not so I guess what I'm getting at is as long as lots of things happen over Christmas break you get you get to think right and so I agree with board member told that there should be enough flexibility this time around that people show up in the new year and say Here's my letter of interest I thought about it over Christmas break

[02:09:00]
over the holidays and but I like the idea of working on this process so I don't know that I'm hearing a clear consensus has made clear that we are going to be talking about that during the governance manual review so is that sound yes I just wanted to go back to board member told me to I know you made a comment about this topic but was there any other suggestions that you wanted to say around the entire implementation calendar or yes I do have to just one area and and cuz I don't see policy committee written

[02:10:00]
in some of these especially when we're looking at adoptions I don't see it running through policy committee I see it going through ad hoc so could you clarify where the policy committee is written in here or is it just the work going to be done through ad hoc so the so the Committees so the cup there are only a couple of committees that are kind of proposed on here the first one and this is one that that was talked about with a couple of board members but I wanted to have a conversation with the full board as well especially because I didn't get to talk to is it with all of the new board members we kind of divided divided in Concord with our one-on-one interviews so the previously when the board went through the process of developing the governance manual they were very clear about

[02:11:00]
I'm going through an ad hoc so they established an ad hoc committee to do that aside from the policy committee because they wanted to they wanted to make sure that the most people had the essentially you've got kind of a distributed Leadership Model where you have you got your policy committee and then you've got your this this committee is going to work on these policies and then you all come together and have discussions about them as a board so I think that's the only one that specifically has to deal with policy there may be there so reviewing the community engagement policy and then there was another one so that would be through the community so doing a small ad hoc Committee just following up on that Community engagement

[02:12:00]
is it raining just to say okay this is what we discussed in the training now let's move policy and if you all chose to do it through a committee instead you could or through a policy committee I wanted to continue to honor that expectation of having as many touch points or giving people as many opportunities to to show leadership and to kind of take charge of different parts of the implementation so that's why it's structured that way and that's all just the way that the board has historically done it but again you all can do it how how you all feel like you need to it's just you know some of the language I think and and going back to what board member you know rushing and really looking at some of these details and how we write it because I want to believe that we're going to come back to these conversations and really change and make sure that we

[02:13:00]
are you know for an example in January 2025 under unity and trust is his board receives ad hoc recommendations for revisions to the board operating procedures manual and so that's where I have a question okay an ad hoc committee or is it policy but it's one of the things that and as we were talking and these conversations I would hope that if those things become clouded at any time to us at board members as board members that we could come back and read these things because I don't want this to be law or precedents to why we're doing what we're doing and if we pass it that this is going to be the stick to and adhere to timeline that we need to and as you're talking to you said we can do it on what we want but I just want to know when will that occur if we adopt it so I mean the car

[02:14:00]
I'm having the conversation right now is the board so this is this is the time for you all to discuss it but if at any point you all identify and what I keep saying you all because the board only acts as the board so even when you have an ad hoc committee ad hoc committee is just there to kind of do the heavy lift on a very specific piece of the work and then bring recommendations back to the board they can't no no tube board members or three board members or however even your standing committees and they still have like their their work still has to be brought back to the board for final that final discussion and that final decision and so nothing can happen with just one or two people so if there ever any if the board decided that you needed to do things differently or you need to take a different approach then you should absolutely come together and have those conversations because that's

[02:15:00]
on this ad hoc committee for the governance manual specifically that's how the board did it before so we I stuck with that same process because that's that's the way that you all have historically done it if that's not the way that you want to do it you can this is the time to have that conversation are there any comments I have a comment what is the point of having a policy committee if they're not going to be tasked with policy work reviewing the policies and I don't mean to sound sarcastic when I say that I'm just really genuinely curious so you have there's a lot of other policies that the board considered Beyond these but also the board doesn't I mean

[02:16:00]
not all boards have policy committees some boards do not all boards do a lot of boards choose to handle all policy as a board the way that you deal with policy is is your prerogative whether you put that through a committee or you have you just embrace all of those as a full board is your decision but there's also I mean even currently there is all I see that you consider every single thing that the word like both song that is policy and so a lot of things that you vote on that is policy that doesn't go through the policy committee but policy work is is predominantly what the board does so you I mean you all can decide if the policy committee is something you want to stick with it sounds like it is if it's not then you all can make that decision as well

[02:17:00]
but how the that really is a conversation for you all to have any other comments so I think specifically the question about the like the ad hoc committee and why we do those and kind of the way that I think about them is that there are ways to for just a smaller group to like roll up our sleeves and get get into the Nitty Gritty that takes a little bit longer to do to kind of maybe have more I don't know digging down deep conversations that take a while that kind of like weeds out the I don't know I'm just visualizing like I rolled up my sleeves and I'm digging and I can't think of a better way to say this but so the ad hoc committees

[02:18:00]
call for like the hard work to the the dirty work to be done so that by the time it gets to the board it's more it's it's kind of consensus which kind of which seems to help sometimes with the efficiencies and so one example I think of is when Josefina and I did the governance manual that took us a while to do I mean it took us months to do and and I think part of the reasons that she and I were placed on that was because we were the two that were participating in the cohort the cohorts and so we we were in the cohort so we were already kind of getting trained on that mentality of what a governance manual is and so it kind of made sense for the two of us to take that work that we were doing with the cohort and overlay it onto the governance manual now that doesn't mean that the government's manual didn't come before the entire board right we put together the recommendations then it came before the

[02:19:00]
two more times before it was owned and crafted down to what the whole board wanted but you'll actually I think it actually went to the policy from from your committee it went to the policy committee and then it went to the board and I think y'all I think at that point y'all were like we've looked at it maybe that was one too many steps yeah but I don't know I I think sometimes what I would I keep shutting is going back to when we when I was first elected and having long long long long long meetings because all of the work had to be done from here because every single committee was a committee of the whole and so having a having Committees of the whole create very long meetings create an efficiencies so having kind of smaller at Hawks allows two of us three of us to get together do the work bring it before the board but also to always sleep to give the reasons as to why certain things happen so

[02:20:00]
I like the way I talked to work if you excuse me I have to sew while you know ideally yes they may be very efficient but what I have seen this year is we've been more siloed and perhaps that was because there were so many ad-hocs that it was hard to get a sense of all the movie plates and I would argue that having the ad hoc from the policy committee work on something and then report back to the policy committee would be ideal because you get more eyes on it and it ends up

[02:21:00]
mean a kind of onboarding because it's been in the policy committee where we've had conversations about does this work for us do we need to clarify this meaning the manual the governance manual does this committee I remember one question that board member of store right there are so many policies that the word policy is being shattered all over the place but which policy are we talking about and we take for granted that I remember feeling the same thing there's an administrative policy so anyway those conversations are important to have and you don't get them in an ad hoc committee necessarily unless the ad

[02:22:00]
comes back to the policy committee which is made up of two new members to our board so I'm going to weigh in I think it's important that items the first the first three rows in November are all policy work in reference to the governance manual and that is work that the current policy committee is doing so I would suggest that this under owner it would be the policy committee to take responsibility for roll roll number

[02:23:00]
123 and if there's a need or if it if the committee decides that they want to break break up those pieces within the committee and then we report back to each other and then and then it goes to the full board but my preference is to keep it within the committee so the reason so when the board did it previously so there was there was a pretty strong there was a pretty strong feeling at the time and that was also conveyed through our conversations that they didn't they wanted to there was a desire

[02:24:00]
spread the work to spread it out Beyond just the policy committee so the policy committee is I think you've got four people on it now and so spreading it out it actually so this is three really important pieces of work that needs to be done well so two of them are essentially the same the board guard rails I think that really is a conversation for the full board and that's not that's not presented here as a as a hawk because it is something that the full word needs to discuss but the however you all handle the the governing policies that's that's your that's your prerogative but there were some people who had strong opinions about wanting to separate it out and that was also the and that was that was also your perspective last time that

[02:25:00]
I don't remember that but when was that last year under the previous leadership and keep in mind we were getting started yeah right because the board chair the board chair is who appoints committee is not not committee chairs and so that that was awesome but there was some back and forth there as well so the policy committee has already begun we're in the middle of amendments and so what happens then to the work that has been done if we adopt this because then all of a sudden what were creating here is a kind of confusion of resp

[02:26:00]
abilities and work that has already started well I think that the policies that y'all are looking at right now I mean those are going to come forward to the full board and so if those are policies that you've identified and you refined then I would expect that does not be things that you revisit but I do know that there are things that even with this even if the conversation so far has been held some additional work Beyond on the it will require new policies to be added to the government's manual beyond the conversations that are happening right now so for example if you identify a policy for how you're going to if you refine your officers policy that's that's not work that you're currently doing so there's going to need to be like that continued

[02:27:00]
that continued refinement of the government's manual okay but so there's again there's the work that needs everything period and then the committee goes and they do that additional they make sure

[02:28:00]
recover those areas and then anything else that they see that comes up again that's what the process has been so far it's your manual so however you want to do it if you wanted to chime in on this conversation thank you I think it was going to say what is just said that the changes that are moving through the policy committee right now which are like for I forgive you through the process to then be presented to the full board for approval on consent or if a member removes them from consent for approval by the pool board with discussion the purpose of in paneling a committee to review the entire governance manual is to review the manual in its entirety which has always been the plan it was that's what was on the plan for the previous implementation calendar it was always going to

[02:29:00]
to be in November the policy committee chair opted to have a September policy committee meeting to review those specific policies that I mentioned for I 4J 4K etcetera so that's certainly the prerogative of the committee and the chair to do that the idea is to make sure that we're looking comprehensively at the whole governance manual and then also potentially adding things over the course of the year since we've had this governance manual in place there have been a whole host of things that we've had concerns about questions about a lot of feedback that some of the policies that we have in place or maybe not specific enough I would say in particular one is addressing board member individual board member performance concerns that's a policy that I have heard specific numbers want to revisit specifically the policies on committees and have appointed right now is a charge

[02:30:00]
they don't end and so we need to strengthen the ad hoc committee language in that way and then similarly this whole conversation that we just had about the officer elections the timeline statements of Interest all of the very good questions that people just asked that type of information would also be integrated into the governance manual and so the document that supports agenda item 5.2 the discussion report where list out essentially what strategies do we want to recommend to be able to engage the full board do we want to have focus groups who want to have small group meetings we want to use surveys do we want to use interviews we want to use Google Docs that's all for us to determine how we go about the process of changing the whole governance manual but acknowledging that policy by policy in a group of four people isn't inclusive of the whole manual or the whole board

[02:31:00]
they're trying to respond also to the request to be more inclusive and to have more distributed leadership opportunities to this is just a clarification so we got two agenda tonight to agenda items tonight for SOG one is this discussion about the timeline the other is the other one this actual discussion about how you're going to provide Point too okay so this is so this first item is actually the conversation that we're having right now so let me ask this question how many at Hawks do we have currently we have the community engagement and that's Courtney Jackson and there's a Heather and I are on the policy

[02:32:00]
quiet and board member Jackson or who had that I don't know that I'm doing anything and so the whole the training that that we are proposing for December actually will that presents an opportunity for you all to

[02:33:00]
really talk about how you're going to engage in like how you're going to engage your committees and how how you're going has it all relates to your time use so that that conversation really that will be an opportunity for you all to dive more deeply into the end of this conversation you know looking forward thinking about how you want to engage with committees so that so that will happen at that point but for this for this conversation and that's why it's it's worded the way that it is worded on the timeline if deemed to priority by the board and panel a committee to refine the government's manual so what I'm hearing though is that there would be the entire but the entire board take sections of it or would we all be in on the

[02:34:00]
reviewing the inside so here's my my warning about that because we all want to be part of that conversation and and if we divide it up in the name of efficiency we're going to miss something because it's all too much it's not the proposal that's on the table that's not the proposal that's on the table and if that is if the entire board wants to be part of the conversation and my recommendation is that you don't make it a committee that you actually schedule a workshop and you have a work session it will you use of time I think it's a time but that but it will be it will be use of time that you need to set

[02:35:00]
workshop on the governance manual and I don't think a single person expressed an interest in that in response to the survey and so to the final point that Ashley just made yes and the context of the December training that we're having our time to our priorities that is an opportunity for us to discuss the government's manual so again that's a 5.2 and it's up to us during a item 5.2 to discuss how we do the process but we could appoint a three-person group and they can go and interview Every Other Board member and get feedback and engage however they want and make it during the December training and then presented again during a January

[02:36:00]
it's completely up to us how and to what extent we want to involve individuals or the full board but I think the notion is it is a comprehensive document with the need for a lot of track changes into member Jackson's Point really getting into the dirt and the weeds and so if we're not going to do a full day session which people said they don't want to do the other alternative to do that was through a smaller group with an ad hoc committee so let me clarify perhaps I don't know why people didn't choose a workshop time but I think there was confusion about well we have we have a we're working on the policy committee is working on the governance manual so it may not have made sense without this conversation and clarification

[02:37:00]
just as an explanation of why people don't want the policy committee wasn't working on the governance manual this so again like this had been on the agenda implementation calendar always for November and when I think you raised concerns about committees and board committees in particular that was when we started the conversation in that September board meeting about potential late October and September board meeting around potential Retreat and that's when we did the survey so it was trying to respond frankly to your questions into your concerns and your desire for more full board engagement and inclusivity and so you asked for more training and we asked what training people want people didn't want the workshop we are delivering the training that people did Express that they want through this implementation calendar that's presented right now

[02:38:00]
that we're trying to organize and schedule and so if things seem out of sequence that's only because we're really trying to act in real time and respond to all of the feedback from everyone and so certainly this could be a different process where we're not as inclusive and we're not working together to figure out this so if you time and everything else but in the process of trying to be responsive to everyone's concerns questions and all so need for additional training we have slowed down and are changing the government's manual review process because of the feedback that we got just a point of clarification track you know there was a request for maybe some training but mostly it was a retreat and there's a distinction between a retreat and training and the governance can't manual was part of the the the the

[02:39:00]
West but I want to make a point of clarification about the training that you offered on December 14th that is several of us are going to be at the New Mexico School Board Association conference I had blocked out the first week again Thursday Friday but it was an option of three dates it wasn't just the 14th but I do want to get back to this and is there anything that would make you feel more secure and moving on with that specific topic you know I'm not I'm not opposed to I think

[02:40:00]
it's important for the policy committee to be part of the to be in in the loop I like the idea of having the entire board as long as as long as people are being heard and varied perspectives are weighing in on the government's manual but I do think it's important to follow the first and second read that is in that governance manual on any amendments to policy do you feel comfortable in Panama City to refine the areas of governance manual knowing that we all have heard your suggestion of that being the policy committee because it does not it doesn't say how many we couldn't handle the policy committee to continue that work

[02:41:00]
what you just said and panel the policy committee to do that work yes so if we leave you like that with the suggestions that we've heard tonight I think that and still so that would be that would be different that would be so that you would delegate that work to the commit to that committee rather than paneling a new committee right and that's the I think that's where that's where the rub is is it or I guess that's the question are you do you want to have a separate committee the way that I used to talk about right now is just so we can move on is we have a suggestion for the policy committee to continue the work is on November 20th for implementation timeline to continue the work of the governance manual review you're saying that's what it says and you're saying so right now it says to

[02:42:00]
what channel is committee but policy committee chair has suggested that that work continued through the policy committee instead of a new committee so I just want to get consensus if that's okay with folks or if they don't want that so we can move on from that topic so yes that's what I'm saying yes personally I don't believe we need a new committee because I feel like the current committee now has been pretty effective and thorough you know I'll be honest I'll speak for me like I think if we put all of us back on it like it's we saw what that did right I guess some of us and I think the time associated with that we weren't as effective in making progress when it was just the few that are there now that dove into it and really

[02:43:00]
dove into the weeds for me I'm not on that committee but I don't feel like my voice isn't hurt I do feel pretty confident that if I have a concern or a question I can address it and I've never felt silenced even without having served on that committee so for me I don't feel the need to have all of us participate on it president Gonzalez yes so the reason it is not automatically delegated to the policy committee is because board members expressed interest in additional people having the opportunity to lead and so in this context it is the four individuals who are on the policy committee responding to proposals that are proposed I don't think by the full committee is that right I don't think the full for committee membership

[02:44:00]
meditation prioritize for I forgot for K it was the policy chair working in context with this in concert with the staff to do that and so the idea is to say okay it's not the policy chair and the staff changing the governance manual it is a subgroup of people looking comprehensively an hour full governance manual and when I say that I mean like two people our whole governance manual looking at other model governance manuals from other districts engaging with the full board and that's why we asked for suggestions about what that could look like around what is missing and what are concerns from the current government in Spanish and present revisions to the full board for consideration I hear remember Domingos say that she would like those recommendations to go from the ad hoc to the policy and then to the full board we can certainly consider that I think the other thing that I did hear though just a big old is that doing that last time was

[02:45:00]
too many steps so again the purpose is to give additional people the opportunity to develop the government's manual and in part I think two people developed the first draft and so would like to have additional people have an opportunity particularly new board members to weigh in on what ought to be included in the revisions thank you president Gonzalez are there any other comments from other board members again I think that this is this is a way so what it says right now in panel and a committee where are we where are we even go on thank you to refine the areas of the governance manual that the board has identified I mean I love I love that idea like let's get other people looking

[02:46:00]
I've looked at this to my eyes have turned red so I would love to see A New Perspective on this to see to see what what you know what we missed when we did it the first time and so I I think with so much of the feedback that we're getting of it's only you know a few people that I have other people weigh in on this and and have the opportunity to look at that knowing that there will be a robust Outreach to all the board members so that everybody has the chance ultimately to weigh in on it but you know let's let's have some people who haven't had a chance to really dive into it take that opportunity so to answer your question I think it's fine the way it is

[02:47:00]
it's it's always a good idea I think that what you'll find is the same people who wanted to be on the policy committee are also going to volunteer for the ad hoc committee and right and so and I encourage them to do so so you know if this is what we're going to do then the same people will step up because I think the policy work is very difficult and there's there was a bus who maybe can't fit it in and so

[02:48:00]
you know I think it's an opportunity for people who do this and are that are very good at it to really shine and so if this is the way the board is going to go then and we can do that but I also want to make very clear we have a policy committee specifically for this purpose so no hearing is remember benavidez and board member of happy Romero are going to be on the ad hoc Community know it was a joke I love it I love it okay so add hot committee derived from the policy committee is that what I'm hearing I wanted to make my comment real quick oh yeah I don't agree with an ad hoc committee okay um doing this work just because I have had concerns about interpretation on the government's man

[02:49:00]
play AliExpress multiple times and coming from if two people are working on it which is kind of what are normal ad-hoc committee is that's what that can bring again so I am in agreement of having the policy committee work on it just because it gives a more of a scope for people that are already interested in that work compared to just two people I would be open to bring it back to the policy committee or to the board to have those conversations because my biggest concern is we have people working on it that their own interpretation and then the rest of the board is not on that same page so that's kind of where I stand with that I think Ronaldo oh yes a board member to thank you with some Janelle that let the policy committee do the work that one they voted for we elected them we elected the chair

[02:50:00]
be there so I would think that we would allow that to happen because I think a majority of time just as also Heather stated that there are those who want to do that work and I think we should allow that and and it's a choice rather than creating an ad hoc to where the you know their appointed to those positions and they do that work so I think that one keep the policy committee the policy committee and those who do want to work on that work allow them to work on it and I think if in our processes we have to let somebody or put people in those positions I think we should allow them to opportunity to do that work and so I am for policy committee thank you all right so I think I think I'm hearing we're going to send it to the policy committee I'm going to reserve the rest of this conversation for 5.2

[02:51:00]
I want to move to president Gonzalez for any suggestions or comments that you might have had for this timeline thank you secretary historica I think I've partly said in the context of the conversation my comments which is just the the cancel great City School staff worked really hard to take the feedback that they heard from the board around everything in terms of our learning needs our governments are continuous Improvement needs our understanding of students but also the need and the desire to continue to prioritize student outcomes and student outcomes focused governance and so I think it's helpful for us to continue to rely on the coaches but also listen to their coaching and expertise and so the calendar that is presented to us is based on their coaching their work that they've done with other districts presented to us because it reflects

[02:52:00]
the feedback that we provided and so I think helpful for us to be mindful in deferring to that expertise as well and so I am appreciative to the council staff for the work on the implementation calendar and for your ability to try to consolidate seven different perspectives into one document which is a huge Challenge and I'm supportive of the calendar as written with the amendment that we strike the second review of the policy diet or the second policy diet process and so if I could offer a friendly amendment to member Jackson's initial motion to approve it would be that that we strike that second policy diet process

[02:53:00]
I have no comments or suggestions I think this was a very fruitful conversation so with that President Gonzalez I don't know if you want to call for hold on just one second let me make sure I just I just wanted to do a quick review to make sure that I don't have any other questions for you all before you move on I think that we're I think that we're good yes we are we are good period thank you sorry about that okay so there was an initial motion from Member Jackson and the second from remember Dominguez member Jackson amended her motion to strike the policy diet the second round of the policy diet and remember to give you support the amendment as well since you made the second

[02:54:00]
can we have a roll call vote please do you know the store yes yes yes yes yes yes Courtney the motion carries and we have a new sfg implementation timer for our next conversation which is agenda item 5.2 a discussion on and handling a group of board members refine the Board of Education governance manual this is not an action item this is a discussion item only and so we have to start we've started the discussion already and would like to just draw a board members attention to the support document for 5.2

[02:55:00]
which describes the previous describe the previous process that we use to create the initial governance manual Who was appointed initially when the work happened how many reviews of the initial governance manual there were and acknowledging that they're all that there has been changes to the policy within the policy committee already and that those will continue to proceed through the regular policy development process board members were asked to come to this meeting with responses to four questions which were one what strategies would you recommend be used to gather feedback from the full board and so this was enough to make the process more inclusive so if we do keep it with four member policy committee what additional strategies do we want to implement to make sure the full board has an opportunity to weigh in the second question is a complete complete the sentence I will complete I will

[02:56:00]
if the third question what core principles are goals should guide any changes to the governance manual and then the final one whether you're interested in serving on the ad hoc committee I heard loud and clear from Members going to be this and top your Romero that they would like to co-chair this committee and Lead all of the work so besides that everyone else has an opportunity to weigh in as well and so we'll just go ahead and start at the beginning with strategies recommended to be used together actually before we go to those four questions I'm going to I will turn to you as to see if you have any other feedback around how we pursue this conversation but I was going to say before we get into the four questions we can pick up where we just left off around whether this gets delegated to the four-member policy committee or to a subset of two members of that policy committee or something else I think that the

[02:57:00]
since you have poster are good I just want to also so the the timeline has the work of that committee being completed in January so we want to make sure that we are mindful of that and in this discussion thank you Anna that is really helpful reminder which was the other reason why perhaps working through the policy committee might not work because that one is as meeting is already scheduled for December and January so those would be the only two opportunities for that committee to meet and introduce changes but if we do do a group of two people within that Paul December to the board whenever it is that we do our December training get feedback they could

[02:58:00]
send the feedback to the policy committee at that January 6th or 4th I don't have in front of me first policy committee meeting of the year and then present to the full board in the first January meeting of the Year and that would keep us on track for approval according to our calendar so just a question go ahead go ahead and have an opportunity to review the draft changes on December 14th or 21st whatever it is that we do the training and we're all going to be together then it would go to 1st Street in the timeline that I just

[02:59:00]
now in January 6th that policy meeting if it passes through that it could go to board consent with the regular board meeting on January 15th there's got to be a 30-day public policy development policy requires that there's a 30-day review on the February 5th regular meeting that would

[03:00:00]
and it says the second reading is not second reading is not required unless the policy committee chair or president determines that the amendment needs further study so it could it could I mean it's whatever everybody wants but just as far as this 4J is saying it doesn't require the 30 days because it would be considered an amendment well know it says or in that paragraph says to ensure that policies are well

[03:01:00]
the board will adhere to the following meeting sequence in considering and adopting proposed new policies or policy amendments so it's either or second meeting number three says an amendment will not require that the policy go through and it does a third meeting right here where president determines that it needs further study so I mean it could be determined that it needs further study I'm sorry I'm just being yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes so we just need the second meeting so I think we're a lot of great paid off I think we're agreeing that it would just need the second meeting

[03:02:00]
prior to January 15th and wait until the February 5th board meeting

[03:03:00]
was having an ad hoc do the the initial work to present it at December 14th 20th or 21st whatever that ends up being to the full board then then any revisions would come back at that that Retreat or training then it went from there those revisions would go to policy in January to the policy committee and then to the full board is that what your is that what you just laid out that is what I laid out in response to the request to have it run through policy committee

[03:04:00]
we don't need to we could also have people work on it presented in its first draft form in December make revisions and then bring it back to a full board conversation on January 15th and so perhaps we don't need to make that full decision right now if we were to just say a subgroup of two people from the current policy committee will work between now and December 13th 14 whatever on the draft so that they have something to prepare and present to the full board for that December training and then maybe depending on the extent of the changes or the extent of the feedback we would determine then if it needs to go through what what subsequent steps of meetings I do want to pause though and check with

[03:05:00]
Ford Services office just given the deadlines that we have for meeting preparation and meetings being available does that time flow work we can make it work OK Google of the policy committee to the initial work to present at the retreat gather feedback go to full policy in

[03:06:00]
free full board later in January so we determining who those two people are is that what we're doing right now I feel like we're all over the place and if I don't care how is that decision going to be going to be made because I think that that's important because I know that there are a lot of people who probably want to work on this and those people are probably already on the policy committee and I think it's important that you people aren't left out I think that is a suggestion right now is that the people two people from the policy committee will be working on that so are there anybody from the policy committee that would like to work on that subject me and the deadline is probably December 13th I believe you said president Trump's or report back I was making it an estimate based on if the retreat that we're doing is either December 20th or the 21st having stuff done by the 17th would give a week review time for

[03:07:00]
I think it's important to have new members a new member on there because that that they bring an important perspective right they they are looking for clarity so so that means either or board member of Oregon so I'm just throwing that out there as soon as I know about two events then I can say I may be able to do it but right now for my schedule is currently stand

[03:08:00]
thank you I'm willing to be on that subcommittee so we just need one other person and so that leaves veterans Elementary it sounds like one of the questions on the floor is also how does everyone how does everyone want to make sure that the their feedback is collected and they and they feel like this is a

[03:09:00]
an inclusive process and we we we we we have a policy analyst who is happy to feel suggestions and get them to go to if I may interject so I do want to make sure that we are able to hear from the full board on strategies that are recommended to gather feedback certainly the policy analyst will play a role in taking edits and monitoring the Google Docs and making the edits Etc but I don't want us just to assign it entirely to her so there were the four questions that we had and put those aside to talk through the process overall so I think we're clear on the timeline it will be two people who are currently on the policy committee meeting policy committee sorry at least one of those is secretary historica so if we take the bottom question whether you're interested in serving on the ad hoc committee

[03:10:00]
yes interested yes but I was sorry if we can transition to that question it's been put on the table that one of those strategies will be sharing feedback through Miss Martinez as everyone did their pre-work prior to this meeting did others have other suggestions for strategies to be inclusive of the full board

[03:11:00]
proposed and you know just to encourage transparency the only question I have for that was a great idea but I want to make sure that that's so we don't have to have the answer right now but we need to make sure that that's not going to run a foul of your meetings about that yeah Chrissy as long as the viewers only and not commenters it should be fine with it so I think there's two two things one is allowing the full board to weigh in on and have transparent access to the changes the other is I think a couple of steps before that it would be helpful if the entire board would review the governance manual in its entirety And if every member of the board would share their feedback with the committee so

[03:12:00]
that we have a complete and comprehensive assessment of what changes the board wants to make I think board members can say look I reviewed it and I don't have changes or look I didn't have a chance to review it but I do think we need to start from a opportunity for everyone to weigh in on the front end and so I think that question is do you want just everybody to send do we want everyone just to send their feedback in everyone to put their feedback in a Google Document everyone to or do we want to do phone interviews or small groups or a survey what are the processes that work best for our board thank you president Gonzalez I I like the idea of doing like phone interviews just because you'll understand more where that perspective is coming from but I know what we're talking about did you have something to say Madam chair for

[03:13:00]
thank you my suggestion would be the Google Docs or the surveys only because personally I tend to do things like after hours like later when everything is silent yeah and I think sometimes did the interviews of the small group meetings would be would be challenging I agree with the surveys specifically because the survey that we we all talked about having a retreat and the way the answers were put in one spreadsheet and we could see everything it was very helpful and I think the survey can be created in a very general way to say you know how do you feel about these this part of the government's manual or just even open it up wider to where are some areas where you think Improvement could be made or things that need to be removed I really like the way it was organ

[03:14:00]
is and then craft it into the document a little bit easier than going from notes to the document so that's my thought on that but then I also have a time line thought depending once we get to that point I'm having a hard time envisioning the survey how that would work

[03:15:00]
I have 1% you know I mean if we go Section by section I guess that I can see that happening but what's every single board member look at the governance manual and the survey will determine if there was any comments or suggestions that those board members had to amend or what we would look at so we don't have to have specific questions on specific sections it really is just a forum for members to give their ideas or their input so that sound like what would weigh in you could wear in section by section if you have feedback on each other we could set it up so that there's like what do you really what's working about this manual what are you really like what

[03:16:00]
it's not working and then even like question like third question first policy what do you think like you could go policy by policy if you needed to you you really can get as detailed or as broad as you want for Christmas

[03:17:00]
need to be a week out from a potential do we know yet board service Dr Albright do we know where it's leaning is it going to be the 14th or the 20th last 21st or do we have an idea yet because I think it's going to back up against when information when the survey needs to be completed so that the information can get to this two-person committee especially with Thanksgiving coming next week I do not have responses from all the board members by the responses very strongly to having it single day December 20th okay so if that's if that's the case then we would need to have information to the board members by probably December 13th right so that's at least seven days ahead of when the retreat would be to have an opportunity to review to be able to bring discussion items to that Retreat on December 20th

[03:18:00]
which and if I'm incorrect please let me know which would mean that this this two person or three person or whatever we decide committee would need to do their work either the week of December 2nd or certainly by December 9th to have all of that information in by the 13th because next week is Thanksgiving you are correct with the with the exception of materials needing to be your drafts needing to be provided a week in advance so that that's not written anywhere we can decide that the retreat is sorry the training is on the 20th and people get the draft on the 18th like we could decide okay so there's a bit of time for the committee to work

[03:19:00]
maybe we can make that decision so if we're going to do it on the 20th then is the are us is board members okay with having information by the 18th yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes it was not thank you that's a better question is developed this week 21st 22nd maybe sent out 26 and I can't see anyone's faces so if you guys are looking at me like I'm crazy I don't know then it would go out on

[03:20:00]
like I said the 26th or 27th and we have Thanksgiving and then it would be due by the 4th I mean I think that would I think that would work if it was due by the 4th then that gives the committee two weeks essentially to review the feedback incorporate the feedback and have it ready as a document to be discussed on the 20th somebody else that works with them as well do we have this timeline reflected in the minutes I just want to make sure that we're accurate yes

[03:21:00]
so the first question was strategies and we determined some sort of a survey with questions to be supported and determined by our coach and the timeline for that survey the next question is I'll feel like this has been a fair and inclusive process if so remember a store if you could just facilitate this conversation around what people need for to leave the process feeling that it's been fair and inclusive are there any more I think I'll be included as I want to be right I'm going to make the effort to do that so that responsibility for first and foremost I believe it's on me and if I feel that that's not happening then I will make that clear but

[03:22:00]
I think that's the plan we have now is going to help it be a transparent process and as long as everybody has the opportunity to give their feedback and every voice is valued the same and questions are answered and nobody feels shamed in the process maybe for not understanding or I don't know maybe turning something in a little late then I think that that's a fair and inclusive process but at the end of the day it really is up to us to take the responsibility to be involved if we want to be involved and if we feel like we're not and we have a responsibility to see that say that too much yeah I think it's a fair process and I'm thankful that I got to at least state that if I'm not able to do the obligation or be part of it I was able to say that and other board members

[03:23:00]
10 so I think the process is fair and that and I think you and I think you guys for that opportunity so I agree with what we want to do as we move forward and I think it worked thank you and thank you remember I feel like in order for it to fill fair and inclusive would be just making sure everyone does have the opportunity not to say that not to be confused that we have to all provide comment on everything but that we were given the opportunity to do so and then to also remember to it's okay to disagree like it's okay for us to think differently and have differing opinions as long as we're respectful but I think that that's normal behavior and I think we need to remember that thank you remember Jackson I don't have anything to add besides

[03:24:00]
so I like dialogue because I learned from other people and as long as there's an Avenue for that I think it'll be there because I'm open I mean I'm willing to rethink position so as long as I have the opportunity to understand that and that comes through dialogue I'll feel good about it thank you I agree with everything that has been stated so far and then would also just want to put in a request with Ashley that as she is designing the agenda for the December 20th training but we have

[03:25:00]
communication around how we're treating this within the agenda and how much time it has because I can Envision a scenario in which we spend 2 hours on the governance manual and a scenario in which we can spend 6 hours on the governance manual and so I think having a pretty clear either protocol or facilitation process for having that discussion in December is going to help us continue to make the process I'm sorry make the progress that we need to make and then I did hear from people that's what's most important is having the opportunity to weigh in and some individuals may decide not to weigh in or not to weigh in in depth and that's great and so I think it's we just need to know when someone has decided not to weigh in and when someone has missed a deadline because the time frame that we just laid out is tight and so if someone

[03:26:00]
this is a deadline by a couple of hours or a day that may be okay but if multiple people Miss multiple deadlines by a couple of days that won't be okay and so I think we just need to be clearer on that so if you're not going to be able to meet the deadline if you could say in advance I will not meet the deadline but I can get it done by next date that would be tremendously helpful if you are not going to provide feedback because you reviewed it and you don't have additional feedback or because you don't have the time or whatever if you could communicate that as well that would be really helpful too thank you I agree with everything to the next question what core principles are goals should guide any changes to the government's manual board member don't worry do you want to answer this one first go ahead and go to someone and then I'll

[03:27:00]
I was trying to pull up my document that I came up with that outlines pretty much goals and principles of for the policy committee and that was promoting transparency

[03:28:00]
every opportunity that we can as an onboarding or orientation possibility for remember Jackson okay so the the core principles that I think should guide any changes to the governance manual include continuity with already established policies and procedures that we have consistency across all of those documents of very strong alignment to student outcomes Focus governance and that being our core driving Northstar as these governance as these changes are being made an alignment with efficiency and an alignment with established efficient

[03:29:00]
governance rules having having a document that is in alignment with with what the actual methodology of governance is and making sure that we are adhering to that are some of my principles so minor pretty simple obviously it's ensuring that our goal stays focused on what's priority and that's our students at that we put aside our own personal what's the word yeah yeah and that we keep them at the Forefront of all of our decisions secondly would be to remember to that simple wins like

[03:30:00]
not to complicate things I think many times we get involved in so much jargon and it's so wordy that the average person you lose them at the first sentence so I think if we could remember that we'll get more Buy in as a whole change I totally agree with it and I think we should all if we can right here and right now agree that our goal is to not get rid of sosg that is not why we're doing this and if anybody has that in the back of their mind that they want to try to amend things to drastically change it to get rid of it that's not what we're here for we are not working on that because I've heard it said over and over that some people just don't like it it or the accusation that people don't like it and they want to get rid of it and I've never heard any of the board members say that we've had questions but we've never said we want to get rid of it so I just want everybody's

[03:31:00]
but to make it better because we don't want to get rid of it thank you president Gonzalez I think two things that I had one was relying on best practice and I think that sort of Echoes another board member already said so many other districts have already gone through this work and have manuals and have been working so I think relying on other districts to determine what's working and not for them the other is there is a definition of consensus that is essentially that I may not agree with the final decision but I believe that my voice was heard and I'm comfortable moving forward and so I think a principal for me is that at the end of the process we agree that we will move forward so if any one of us didn't get our way and if something comes down to

[03:32:00]
the boat or a split vote and your or I am on the losing side we move on and don't make it an axe to grind in subsequent meetings or subsequent policy processes but we commit to working with the document as the majority of the board has approved it or at least the next time and time until we get to the next time of revising it again great thank you I'm going to go back to you board member agree with a lot of the comments made and I just want to add a few things and one is making sure that as we proceed for not only in our governance manual but also you know and some of the other things in policies we create that we can't forget you know the groups we represent especially

[03:33:00]
when we look at Martinez and Yazzie and really clarifying that our representation of each of those subgroups is it also are clear definition of why we want to do these things and you know and I think that our work should be our work and that that one we understand our communities we come from and where are reflection of those communities and that there should be the the voice of having those things in put it in all the things we do and then that awareness that they are groups within our communities within our school systems that are silence and that our voices are very important for those voices to be heard so we always keep those in mind that we represent special you know those parents those groups those who fit in those communities that were always keeping those things in mind

[03:34:00]
that's all I have to say thank you thank you I agree with everything that was said I really I do want to just reiterate with board member going to be just said about being on the same page with s o f g and making sure that we're all committed to the one goal which is our students right so now so agree with board member top you remember I like it simple and straight to the point so I'm excited to work on that and this stuff committee with this manual so I think we got that settled so we don't have to go to the next question so I'll pass it back to you last night did you have any I was going to have anything else I was going to recap but actually I think that there were so many things said that it will be better if I type it all up and send it all out

[03:35:00]
