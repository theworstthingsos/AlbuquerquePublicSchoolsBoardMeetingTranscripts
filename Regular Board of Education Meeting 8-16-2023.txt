all the speakers tonight but if you feel that you were unable to convey your message you may also email us at board Ed at aps.edu in addition for those of you who are here tonight a representative from our service center is here to assist you Mr Gonzales will you please introduce our speakers thank you board member Jackson our first speaker is in person it is shutdown well I have two minutes I have had the opportunity to attend the right size and in that time I have learned a lot I have fought and listened and watched and has some good conversations and there's also been time for reflection and with regard to

[00:06:00]
Coronado expansion plan I thought I knew going in the scope of the issue but it turns out I only knew part of it 6 months after 6 months of being forced to mostly listen I Now understand that and now I understand for parents and I remember that fear but now that I understand the scope of that issue I can see the way forward and rather than Walling them off in their own separate program we need to build a bridge for them so that they can join the rest of the aps bilingual Community Washington is one of the oldest bilingual programs and we just need to throw our arms open wide and we need to embrace the new kid on the Block

[00:07:00]
I'm a Coronado Washington parent and I'm so excited to start building that bridge because I have been to that mountain top and I know how great it is up there so if we can integrate the Coronado students into the Washington program that's the way that everybody wins somebody needs to step up and tell those parents that they do have a solid option right up the road and if you all can at least press pause on the expansion plan then we can have a chance to build that bridge thank you our next few speakers are on zoo Nicholas signal is joining now

[00:08:00]
Nicolet are you there hi I'm here okay Nicolette you have two minutes left at our family daughter

[00:09:00]
45 to 55 minutes after school gets out children affected by this bus route are not getting off the bus until after 5:00 p.m. and not walking in the door until almost 5:15 p.m. also the bus is getting them to school significantly late every morning during the winter months the sun will set around 5:05 p.m. which is the area that runs both north and south of paseo does not have streetlights I feel this is completely unacceptable for children to be getting off the bus and walking home in the dark Rio Rancho public school bell schedule got me to thinking about other ways we can tackle changes with less disruption Rio Rancho has a 42 bus system with 40 minutes between start times their latest school gets out by 3:45 p.m. I know that they are on a six and a half hour day and we are on a 7 hour day I feel it would be better if we could do a six and a half hour day since we are all so on a 42 bus system that is causing a lot of issues from what I understand the late High

[00:10:00]
thank you so much for your time thank you ma'am our next speaker is also on Zoom Erica Davis and I know that you said to me previous addresses situation who are concerned about this time change I also have five kids who have been through the

[00:11:00]
so I have kids and all three Schools elementary middle school and high school and this time change is deeply affecting families the community and especially our middle school kids I've done a lot of research and reading all of the research that has been done on the early early High School start times and one of the things that they encouraged School boards to do is to be cautious of these changes and the the Ripple effects of these changes will have on the communities and I don't know that that's been looked at extensively with the school board our middle school kids like Nicolette said are not getting home off the bus until 5:15 p.m. that's about the time that my husband gets home from work there's school day is about as long as my husband's work day and that is unacceptable and a few months like she said the sun will be going down before the kids get home from school this effect

[00:12:00]
so many things including their extracurricular stuff with neglect already talked about but one thing that I am concerned about is that my child is coming home without any homework which I always thought would be the best thing ever if I didn't have to work on homework with my middle schooler however as my middle schooler transitions into high school I worry about how he's going to transition into his high school years having not had any preparation beforehand with homework in his middle school years also it was mentioned before the basketball kids participated in for years are no longer being able to have their basketball league because there's there's time constraints there this time change is affecting so many but it's actually especially those middle schoolers and people and families that have kids and all three three schools in the elementary school middle school and high school and I invite you guys to relook at this and

[00:13:00]
consider changing some of these times up and consider some of the ideas that Nicolette presented you with the bus schedules thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Rachel Woodard in 2016 the number of Shelter classes offered to come for real students and they still have the ELD level 1 to classes separate from the morning it's been successful as I'm sure you know and Dale Martinez also started a newcomer program I recently learned that the newcomer program that let

[00:14:00]
the bus is real from all over the district to that school why do we not have the same level of activity for our high school or middle school students I'm an ELD teacher at Highland High School or Albuquerque High School and are real students continue to have their levels of support cut as of last year admin cut impact class and this year admin cut the separate level 1 to ELD class so now real students are in every class with their much more English proficient period needed and none of the guard rails will be met for real at AHS or other schools in the district this year I have heard my admin and the new director of the lce compared to teaching Royale in General Ed classes to the same thing as teaching as a teacher having two different with the 7th and 10th grade reading level or a teacher to differentiate for a newly exited Aldi student in a general Ela class they just don't understand

[00:15:00]
I've been working with real for 11 years and I'm working on my dissertation which focuses on real and let me tell you these are uninformed and frankly laughable comparisons to make we need a centralized program or school for a middle school and high school Royale all teachers and administrators understand and are able to cater to their unique needs otherwise they will continue to be a great disparity in their education based on where they are lucky enough to live and attend school please superintendent Elder leave APS with an equitable way to support rail students with a centralized program for middle and high school students all students in APS so that students at AHS and other schools in the district can be served well to thank you thank you for our next speaker should be

[00:16:00]
Century McCoy and should be on zoom and we may have lost them so let me just move on eligibility special education department

[00:17:00]
possible over identification for special education and I just wanted to tell you all that I have been working with families of students with disabilities who receive special education for more than 20 years and I have never received a call from anybody saying that their concern was over identification the concern typically is misidentification failure to be able to get eligibility and identification but over identification is not a concern the other thing is I just wanted to explain and I think I may have talked about this before but I feel that over identification of English Learners is in part the wrong question because the question potentially is that English Learners are over identified in his district based on the district's practices for identification of eel which historically have been have the family out the questionnaire period

[00:18:00]
identify the child as a Yale once the child's in El they have to test out through the access test access testing is 70% weighted on reading and writing if a child is dyslexic or needs structured literacy they're not getting in an ELD class and they cannot test out because they can never perform high enough on the access test that is a reason why families opt out of ELD oftentimes is the student actually speaks English that was always their language they were Miss identified as he yell and they're not getting the reading help that they need so the Board needs to understand how that access test Works kids who are dyslexic and are not receiving special education services are never going to be able to test out of the access to because of the weighted nature of reading and writing on that test and this is a problem that the US Department of recognized in 2015 and its

[00:19:00]
thanks for my historic misperception by school districts that kids can only be one or the other either El or special ed wrong and US Department of Ed said that in 2015 and Warren school districts they needed to start educating people about dual eligibility can you please wrap up in a very quick sentence thank you very much thank you very

[00:20:00]
come to the school board today to express my discontent with the the school calendar for this year and I'm hoping that changes can be made that will be more family-friendly next year the current calendar has too many weeks that are broken into use what I do is useless pieces for example in the month of October we have two weeks that are back-to-back that are short weeks and I'm wondering why that wasn't Consolidated into a when you useful week for families so that they could travel if they have the means to do that or else a camp Camp that could be children could be enrolled in for parents that work it's a beautiful time of year that students could enjoy the outdoors as opposed to the two weeks spring break that was created this year during the month of March which is notoriously ugly and windy as far as weather is concerned here in Albuquerque these short weeks also occur in November and January and I feel

[00:21:00]
very disruptive to the the educational process in the classroom I also believe that the calendar is not family friendly I'm wondering why there's so many professional days for K through 8 but there aren't for high school and I believe this is going to lead to absenteeism especially during the short weeks of school I believe that the school year end before Memorial Day Weekend dragging that families after a four-day week four day long weekend at least 4 days for K through 8 and 3 for high school is unfair especially to high school families that are subject to a final schedule I again believe that absenteeism will be high among the k through eight families if they don't have a high school student I feel that the sand I looked at the Santa Fe schools calendar and I believe they've done an excellent job of implementing the additional instructional minutes divided by the governor by extending the school day slightly without adding days to the calendar they were all so

[00:22:00]
8 8:30 and 9:00 instead of the more staggered time that we have right now thank you thank you ma'am okay and we have Sentry are you there Century hi yes I'm here okay you have two minutes once you begin speaking hi good afternoon everyone elementary teacher available we have no substitute teacher

[00:23:00]
nobody would certification for teaching in that class we only have two educational assistance in their I've talked to the special education director I've talked to the principal everyone's kind of just giving the same on to that they are doing their best which I understand but I feel it's not good enough and especially for our children with special needs I know for myself my daughter regresses fast and you know waiting who knows how long for my child to get an appropriate education is pretty detrimental you know not only for my child but for all the special needs children that are going without a teacher and we look into the situation is there anything else that we can further do my daughter deserves a teacher she deserves

[00:24:00]
education and you know I just really hope that we can put our minds together and really figure out something I appreciate you guys this time thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Ruth Porta how are you you have two minutes and the community

[00:25:00]
I'm with the apsm early early childhood director Allison Gabaldon we're building relationships and and I'm looking forward to be part of the aps Early Childhood passports thank you thank you our next speaker is Jennifer graph 2 minutes and I wanted to always start by saying thank you for everybody that might be online thank you for what you do a lot of times as a former New Mexico child I know I'm older now I have the opportunity to speak to you guys I don't know how many months ago it was and I know I

[00:26:00]
end up with only 2 minutes I left but the reason I wanted to hand out to be left is because we only get 2 minutes and when I think about guardrail number 5 that stop voice and support when I was a kid I knew when my adults were well I knew when my parents were well when they were upset it didn't matter how old I was when I got to school I knew of my teachers were well I know if they were my counselors my counselors in middle school high school high school they saved me in ways that had nothing to do with academics and everything to do with emotional wellness and so the reason that I always get so excited to talk to you guys is because I was born and bred in New Mexico and so I will never stop attempting to go farther Mr Elder I had the chance to see of Christmas when it comes to the entire New Mexico public education area but when I got more involved with the voice and support

[00:27:00]
reminded me that as a principal my title didn't matter as a leader are titles don't matter your Wellness matters we are contagious in a positive way or not and so I wanted to start by asking you to please prioritize your Wellness no matter who is listening via the podcast I mean via the YouTube you know I get confused with the new virtual world where there's a podcast where it's on YouTube I always ask to start your day everyday by knowing how valuable you are and the impact that you're making across our state across your realm in the social setting as well as in your life and I wanted to just say thank you thank you for what you do thank you ma'am I appreciate it we're on the same time I went off the same time Mr Briggs Mr Edgar Briggs is our next speaker Mr Briggs 2 minutes first

[00:28:00]
play comma I used to call him Scott I want to thank you and I'm sure your family will appreciate when you come home the end of the school year and I appreciate all the work you've done as a middle school high school principal and superintendent so that was one time I went I wanted to talk about the car that can make goals that will discuss tonight I applied the fact that your addressing these bills but I do have a concern I like to have the district discuss the educational school kids need to develop a work ethic and expectations and it's like a student

[00:29:00]
receiving a paycheck without working fresh when I was at Manzano High School the lake Dr Krueger I would have freshmen come and see Mr Bridge why am I a freshman again they had no concept of what it meant a credits so they were classified and they said they need to be a whole accountable for that they need to most of the kids when I went to Truman and Grant both and Van Buren they would say well I'm going to school now no earned just I'm going to high school to success in high school you don't earn your credit graduation credits by being there when we build a community school and I was once asked if Community Schools coordinate to test scores yes card numbers Grant Middle School went double over the years every student academic contract if a student

[00:30:00]
add two apps or blow a 2.0 they met with the principal why every two weeks in a cafeteria we had an Uncle Ed talked about getting grades the students met with me every 2 weeks for held accountable when I went to Truman to capture was full of kids that had more than two us know GPA also were involved in a lot of games and activities negatively when we started raining at truman both kids but in the year we had 15 or 20 minutes period

[00:31:00]
go to high school it was amazing they moved back with the senior class by 4 4 4

[00:32:00]
we do not take summer breaks and we have limited holidays enclosures we don't have extended breaks throughout the year that are not helpful for working parents who have to find Alternative Care community-based programs are play-based programs and which extensive research has shown is best for children Advanced countries Embrace play-based learning and their test results prove it it is effective and best for the child I also want to comment that the new bus schedule has caused us as a before and after school program to have to drop several schools because all of the schools are starting at the same time when considering the schedule please consider parents that have to use child care centers for before and after Care thank you thank you and board members that can thank you I just want to thank everyone for who came to speak tonight appreciate your comments

[00:33:00]
definitely hurt them I was I was grateful to hear some suggestions and recommendations on things that we might consider as we move forward with calendaring and just the just moving into this new school year I know that it's been it's been a shift for everyone so I appreciate everyone's comments on that and also just want to give gratitude and appreciation for those that also came tonight to to thank us for listening and being good partners we are definitely doing our best and yes staff Wellness is important to and really appreciate your comments on that for us tonight so we're going to be moving on with our agenda our next item is on student outcomes Focus governance and this is you know for those that all know where we've moved into a new governance model we're focused on student outcomes and looking at ways monitoring we're actually monitoring the goals in the garden

[00:34:00]
hotels that we set forth and came up with in partnership with the community and with the district and so I'm going to turn this item over to we're going to be practice we're going to be practicing again tonight and I know that we do have our coach with us tonight Ashley pause is here with us with the Council of great City schools and what we're taking up tonight is high quality curriculum and instruction and all are presenters have moved to the front of the room we've got superintendent Elder chief of schools doctor saying Luda and our chief academic officer on Antonio Gonzalez and Dr Bowman also with our information and Technology team here so you guys have the floor we'll get started with you and then I think Ashley is going to probably be Ashley do you want to say anything before we go in yes okay I thought you did thank you and it's great to see everyone tonight so as a reminder before we get started

[00:35:00]
into the presentation for tonight's monitoring report the board has an important job and that is to First identify on the monitoring report which you were each have and have hopefully studied you first have to identify are the so you have to respond to the question are all of the all of the elements that are required for a an effective report present so this generally happens by the board chair asking the question does anyone have evidence that any of the elements listed for an effective monitoring report this is the gold the data the interpretation the evidence and plan does anyone have evidence that any of the elements comprise an effective report

[00:36:00]
are not sufficiently present so I wanted to start tonight by posing that question does anyone have any evidence to suggest that any of these elements are not sufficiently present in any three of we can go ahead and talk about all three of them board members so what is it has to have it has to have a definition of what interim guard rail were clearly states what what guard rail and what interim were monitoring has to have I think at least some data or two years worth of two data points and what's the third one but I don't have all my notes I'll make it easy for you I'll just go down the list I want that so first is it clearly show which specific goal or guard well and interim

[00:37:00]
yes yes yes yes yes yes okay next the data does it clearly show data for the three previous reporting periods preferably on a line graph does it clearly show the current reporting period and does it clearly show the target reporting period That's the annual targets and the deadline for the interim goal but the first part it says it's going to increase from like a certain point to a certain point we know that part but there's no data for previous years I mean it's a brand new goal so I mean giving us some Grace yeah the first time we're not and this is a practice session so yeah so the so on this it is missing the prior year I presume that's because that data does not exist right now

[00:38:00]
because these are all new metrics that you're looking at but will give the faculty or give your Administration a moment to respond to that question and just a moment so they're missing that but we can we can presume why it does clearly show the current status and it has the years so each year that that will be monitored is present but it doesn't actually have those future targets showing on a on the line graph so those are those are things that could be added but I have I have a sneaking suspicion for why those are those are not there so I want to keep it open for the board to lift up any other noticing things on this before turning it over to the administration to respond I think it's

[00:39:00]
clear on I know like on the first one 3.1 on the evaluation it says off track on track so wasn't sure what that one was and board member Dominguez said brought that one up because on some of the other I think yeah that's I think we have one that says on track but the first two don't have a definition of whether it's on track or object yeah so that's a great question that's the next section after the data so let's hold on to that one first so first let's turn it over to the administration and let them respond to the data president Montague Cordova members of the board thank you for having us here tonight we are presenting on the three one by one through three just to address some of the concerns about the data this is the first time we

[00:40:00]
are measured this so there is no prior years data because we never we never looked we had a sense and we have conversations but it was not a construed measurement so there was really nothing to compare it to also as far as projecting the growth of the next 3 to 4 years it's difficult with only one you actually have to have two data points to have the sense of how you could develop a growth line so then we are going as we get into some of the later ones we're going to talk about how it some of these broke models are going to be very very difficult and and will explain why is we go through that finally just as quick on the evaluation you got the earlier we had to turn this into you you know pretty early but we can continue to work on it at our end and as we're working through for example our strategic plan we have a really cool tool that we can Mark our progress both individually

[00:41:00]
so as we began to extrapolate the work on the Strategic plan and then actually the work that's being done around these guardrails we feel we can pretty confidently say we're on track but you know this is part of the thing about getting these materials out super early is work sometimes kind of scrambling to get there and so work does continue even afterwards since I will do the best we can to have everything up-to-date but that that evaluation component may be something that you have to wait to hear that moment in in the meeting so but that's what we got so I don't really want to read the whole presentation to you and there's nothing hold on one second because I want to I want to make sure that the board that the board is doing their job first before you go I know you're excited to report so his response is perfectly accurate that is

[00:42:00]
we've actually discussed this with this board before that in order to draw draw a line you have to have two points and this works in data as well you have to have two data points to know what direction your trajectory is going so so that is a sufficient response to why the data is not present I know so superintendent did respond to the the interpretation of evaluation board member Dominguez would you mind stating the question that you had about that or president the the questions that you had about the evaluation so I want to make sure that that your question is sufficiently responded to before we get into it well

[00:43:00]
how how how how do we well regarding the the comment on 3.3 or on track or when you decide that you are on track how will we know what will be the date of Baseline and and then what will be the the Target but I think I'll stop there I feel like he answered the question thanks because he said that they're working you know we're still working with the tools that got this to us early the big moment would come tonight so I think it's I felt like I got the answer to whether we're off track or on track

[00:44:00]
literally exist on the paper Okay so we've addressed the gold the data the interpretation and next is the evidence in the plan so does it clearly show supporting documentation the evidence is the superintendent

[00:45:00]
understanding of system performance if you are not on target or if the superintendent's understanding of system performance system performance indicates implementation is not on track does the report clearly described systemic root causes and strategic responses and any additional next steps and so does anyone have evidence that those things are not present I don't think we have do we I'm proposing that we don't have a causes because we're in the preliminary stages exactly so so the and at this point you're just doing practice monitoring and it is completely acceptable that those things won't be present but part of the practice that we're that we're doing tonight is

[00:46:00]
sing the the board comfortable with understanding how to how to know whether the things are here or not and so on the on the reports you have so on the first page you have your your goal and your data and the interpretation and then on the following Pages it actually lays out what's going well what's not going well and then on the very the very last table is what are we going to do in the next steps so that is so all of the elements are literally present you won't know if they are sufficiently present until after the presentation has been given any questions about this part before you hear the presentation I just have a maybe more of a board Services question so we obviously have our stuff on our computer and we have stuff printed out but we have a whole bunch of people in the audience that cannot see the

[00:47:00]
are we going to be able to put them what we're looking at up on the screen for people at home or are people in the audience to see what we're actually looking at Madam president Jackson we will eventually we're not there yet but the public should be able to click on those links in the NR new site and see the reports so as we talked about this maybe we need to be a little more deliberate about reiterating what we're looking at just to bring the audience along yep and so that's an excellent question board member Jackson because these reports aren't just for the board to deepen their understanding of what the progress progress is being made in the district but it's also for the communities understanding so having the ability to to see and follow along as certainly helpful

[00:48:00]
so and as we as we've already mentioned this is a work in progress this is practice so I feel like we've identified a couple of things that we can improve moving forward and so with that if there are no other questions I'll turn it over to superintendent support the president of the members of the board thank you for allowing us to present I will start with guardrail 3.1 guardrail 3 reads the superintendent will not allow curriculum and instruction that is not district and standards aligned challenging culturally and linguistically responsive and differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students so one address is the percentage of classrooms using grade level high-quality instructional materials and we're proposing to increase from measured amount of 30% in May of 2023 to 70% in May of 2026

[00:49:00]
observations done in the spring it was that it was about forward to us as part of an organizational Diagnostic and that is our starting point as we look at things that are going well and again I guess I'm reading this to you I didn't want to but I guess public I guess I'm reading this to you I apologize one thing we have going on is we have an established system in place to conduct classrooms by District LED teams inclusive a principal supervisors curriculum and instruction special education Language and Cultural equity in Ovid and the good news is we've been doing this for quite a while now question mark we have been able to increase the number of teachers on

[00:50:00]
turn on the K through 5 and the 628 English language arts adoption committee I believe and we're taking increased participation input from Title 1 special education Indian education curriculum and instruction and Language and Cultural equity on the adoption process and selection so the goal is always to increase participation but I think more importantly engagement it's one thing to come to the meeting and sit in the meeting and not operating thing and leave and I'm not doing we're trying to really engaged teachers in our Educators in this work around the curriculum adoption to make sure we get materials are Middle School administration attended mathematics School leadership training during the spring semester mathematics is a great program I'm very excited by what I can offer to really improve outcomes for students in 8th grade and so it's really important that our leadership in those schools understands how it works so they can properly provide feedback to the people who are presenting it

[00:51:00]
last year each Middle School participated in the Southern Regional Education board curriculum and instruction review process which analyzed quality instructional practices and alignment of curriculum that happened in the spring of 2023 and It produced an exit Report with recommended next steps for each individual school on an individual basis so those are very helpful and it's it's a good experience for the schools we have continued to develop Partnerships with instructionally based apartments so for example we are really working hard with special education and curriculum and instruction to make sure we aligned instructional materials that you don't create two sets of curriculum for children who may be disabled and are not getting the general curriculum we are also very pleased that we can report that we have high quality instructional materials for students who speak Spanish it is true that our community is growing and that probably is a area of growth for us in terms of

[00:52:00]
text books that are in other language other than Spanish but right now we've done quite well in English and Spanish we have adopted high quality construction materials for English Learners K through 12 and there's an increased demand for professional development specifically pertaining to bilingual in English language development and I think you've heard that talked about quite a bit recently so what's not going well so we don't currently have a system to ensure all teachers are utilizing a highly qualified instructional materials consistently throughout the district we have a system that does that has to be modified and we will then have the system to do this we do not necessarily have a k through 12 data collection 3.1 and that's one of our next steps is to develop that that tool that's what we use currently over the years some Middle School educators

[00:53:00]
the year one implementation of the new illustrative Mathematics Curriculum has been challenging due to the rigor of the tasks and having to learn how to navigate a new resource that's something we're going to look at how we can improve and support those teachers and interview teachers are interviewed students requested more engaging instructional materials that comes from an earlier report in the spring and then we do need to adopt a consistent K through 8 English language arts curriculum that does meet the New Mexico public education Department's definition of high-quality instructional materials and we have also noted that there's a lack of consistent use of high quality instructional materials specifically in small group pull out special education classes area where we're going our next steps again we talked about the system to ensure teachers are utilizing high quality instructional materials consistently throughout the district in English language arts and Mathematics and I want to be real

[00:54:00]
put on this because this one is the one that triggers people on both sides it is one thing to have the materials and you have to use them I'm really looking at tier one that first teach kids need to be exposed to good materials and for a lot of our teachers there's lesson plans are involved in that there's videos there's this is an exercise is assessments it's all connected that's great for tier one but it's not scripted it's and you know I don't expect everybody to be exactly the same place and teachers always modify teachers always intervene with interventions for students who are struggling and that's the art in the teaching so that still exists so even though we want to make sure the materials are consistent I do want to say it's not a it's not the it's not the robotic wrote day one you say this day to you say that and hope everybody gets it there's always going to be

[00:55:00]
teachers teaching and modifying an intervening secondly we have to develop a procure a tool that's aligned to the observation instrument the tool will be used by District teams after we do a calibration process because you have to make sure and consistent scoring occurs across classroom walkthrough so make sure that what I'm seeing is the same thing that someone else is seen and that we are consistent in our implementation we started this back when we started a very different type of teacher evaluation and they were trying to calibrate us to make sure that the state we were doing the same thing it's it's difficult work but it's meaningful and it's helpful and it really supportive of teachers if they're getting consistent feedback on that feedback carefully designed the roll out for the utilization of any new high quality instructional materials but we have quite a bit in the

[00:56:00]
we understand the need to have a clear design and professional development opportunity and establish diverse venues for student feedback around the materials they are exposed to as part of their coursework so listen to kids and saying is this working what's not working what's the problem with it so that we can make modifications as needed with the materials we do have to buy a K through 8 English language arts curriculum that meets the New Mexico pet definition of high quality construction materials which will be based on a broad and comprehensive input process including stakeholders so that we can select and purchase these materials this year each high school will be reviewed by the southern region educational board Creek Elementary

[00:57:00]
get objective feedback and it's not about you know this person or that person it's really about what are you doing as a school what do you could you improve and what are you doing well and don't throw the baby out with the bathwater and then ensure that general education classrooms and the high-quality instructional materials used in those studies are mirrored and special education classrooms so those are the the steps of the next few years that will be working on and that ends a report on 3.1 so we stand open for questions okay do we want to just go through each report is that the easiest way for us to do this that's up to you so how are you doing I think I would I think we should just do that because I think there was probably questions on on each on each monitoring report so thank you superintendent Elder for reading all that and I think our audience has a idea of all the

[00:58:00]
I think I know we all had a chance to ask questions I think there were questions on 3.1 and I think we got some responses is there I guess what I'll do is like you know the goal is for us to ask questions that are we want us to to stay with technical first so that we could practice that or do you want us to just practice our questions yeah so I'm sorry I thought I misunderstood I thought you were going to go go into presenting the next the next Garden so this is great so yes the board did a wonderful job of presenting questions in advance which you were able to do because you received the monitoring report in advance and again this is this is an ongoing continuous improvement process so it's going to get

[00:59:00]
better every single time the questions that you asked in advance should have been tactical focused or technical Focus so these are questions that are specifically trying to understand how the data was collected who was who was measured and the so the details around the technical and tactical aspects of the data collection process and then strategic questions are more focused on what the how the report and the data that is collected in the report and the information that was provided both in the report and presentation are related to the goal or the guardrail so in this instance the guard rail so we're going to do this the same way we did it last time one board member will ask a question and I'll provide real-time coaching on that so do not

[01:00:00]
are you afraid to to miss State anything this is a this is a learning opportunity so I want to make sure that everyone has Grace and both that they are giving themselves Grace and their colleagues so with that who will be the first to ask a question they're all like looking down looking up don't want to ask a question totally inappropriately and we'll work through it so my technical question that I sent you that it was a technical question was where the 30% number came from and I felt like I got a circular answer was

[01:01:00]
it was a tuned and how do we know it's valid well it was from a tuned and I felt like that was just a circular a circular answer and I understand that it's what it's that's not an accusation it's the position that that were in with just launching into this so so my next step and I'm not sure if this can I provide a little bit of feedback on that because that this is not the last time that that will come up maybe even tonight so board members when you feel as if the responses that you receive are kind of going going in the circular like just we're talking in circles so it is acceptable to say that to your superintendent ideally beforehand before the session because that ensures that he will have time to respond and

[01:02:00]
and and make Corrections before the monitoring session but there are always going to be times when you know we we have questions about the validity of data it is the better way or the best way to ask that question is not necessarily is it valid because that's the response it's going to get it's rather than asking is it is it valid instead consider asking what the degree of confidence they have in that reporting or in that number is that opens the floor for a lot of different a lot of different ways to discuss the issue at hand and it also doesn't so not asking yes or no questions and that isn't

[01:03:00]
specifically a yes or no question but it also kind of opens the floor for a yes or no question or a simple response like that and so that's you know the response is going to be is as simple as the question is so if we ask how do we know it's valid or to what degree of confidence we have that really just opens up the the dialogue and it doesn't it doesn't necessarily suggest any anything that could be interpreted as an accusation or suggestion that maybe it's not valid rather you can you can discuss the degree of confidence that they have leads to a level of this conversation

[01:04:00]
play needs yeah may I ask that question what is what is your level of confidence in in the data okay have never been asked that question before I don't really know what number to throw back at you but I'll say is this I'm pretty confident in the number I don't feel uncomfortable with it only because in the agency with everything else you know the community forums through the established that we already have done that we know but great deal of confidence provides valuable feedback I think moving forward you're going to get more data points this number is going to change and I don't know which way it's going to go

[01:05:00]
I suspect it's going to go up but I don't suspect it's going to go up a huge amount this first year but I do believe it will go up and be a part of the reasons we'll see more classrooms and the people who are doing these it's not just one person in the classroom it's a team of people and so we calibrate those those observations so it's more than one person putting eyes on it you know that in a classroom if you spend any time in a classroom a lot of stuff going on and your head's kind of swiveling around and you're seeing this kid over here and you might not be seeing what's going on over there and with the team you get a more complete picture of the entire situation of the whole contact so I think it's this number evolves I feel more and more confident about it but this is our just and again remember we are in this is a snapshot in time this is where we were on that day or those that way and we're moving forward so this is

[01:06:00]
is on page 7 of the organizational diagnostic it's reversed where it's talking about 70% of observed classroom so I think that's where they got 30% cuz I had a similar question where did the 30% come from and I think it came from that page so just be very specific to what your question was that's where the 30% came from it was it was from 19 so this is also probably so Ashley I'm going to ask for coaching to see if there's a way to ask this because I guess I need to start from an example and then figure out how to ask a question about it okay if I'm using a glad strategy

[01:07:00]
if someone walked into my classroom to see one point of my teaching that's using a glad strategy you would not see grade level curriculum you would see me developing a framework for students to understand the grade level curriculum and so I guess in the process I mean I I think I'm not so much worried about the number I don't I don't like the way it makes education I don't like what it conveys of teachers not teaching I think that is inaccurate observation I think it gives the wrong impression to the community of what is going on in classrooms but I think that it's a number that's still can help us practice Elevate practice practice practice

[01:08:00]
so I'm going to disregard the 30% in a sense because I think the goal is how do we help teachers so in the development of that tool and I'm not sure where this gets asked or how and what framework it gets asked and maybe it should have been asked more pointedly in my initial questions in the questions I sent it but it's really what's what's the process and how much practitioner voice will be in the tool that that continues to get developed because I think that there does need to be a level of full range of practice in a classroom and that's why that's why the snapshot has an element of helpfulness but how we develop that into something more meaningful that more

[01:09:00]
appropriately engages practitioners I think is Israel question and maybe that appropriate question for tonight or not know there's there's actually a couple of things here so first of all you you asked so you asked a couple of different questions in there that I want to lift up so first of all what's the process and really it's what's the process and what is the and what is it actually measuring that is definitely a so that is both a tactical question and and what is asking what is the process and then what are we truly measuring are we truly measuring so we're taking a snapshot of what the of what the what happened on that day and time or at that period

[01:10:00]
then I think what the so this is me kind of reading between the lines so I'll need you to confirm whether this is getting to the heart of what you're asking what does that snap what can we actually learn from that snapshot that is useful in actually understanding how the high quality instructional materials are being used or does this does what does this tell us about the prevalence of the use of high-quality instructional materials there are a lot of different ways that that can be asked but it's all getting to the to the core of the same question of this is a snapshot in time what does it actually tell us about the systemic implementation and and so how does the date so asking the question how does the data that we've received so what can you learn from the day that we

[01:11:00]
I've received to inform these district-wide implementation that actually is a strategic question cuz you're getting to the heart of what the what the understanding is of the data and how it is being used to achieve the goal of the district or in this case honor the guardrail of the district I don't know if I see head nodding but I'd like to hear from you is that is that getting to the heart of what you're trying to understand or do we need to talk through it some more I think that's helpful I'm not sure that I can restate it but I found it helpful yeah so something as simple as what can some looking at this at this 30% number what what does that tell you about the system systemic implementation of high quality

[01:12:00]
National materials and how does that how will that improve our our practices moving forward which really is the the big question for this monitoring session okay I'm going to say I'm going to contemplate the process vary so that we are capturing the full breadth of what teachers

[01:13:00]
it was at a higher we were evaluating synthesizing so I'm at 30% on Monday but so how how will the process allow for a more complete understanding of what's happening in the classroom board members just a reminder that this particular element doesn't ask to do that just asked us to look at the use of high quality construction materials the rest of the walkthroughs that we do involve exactly what you're describing but for the purposes of this guardrail this room that's not included but the walk through process is not

[01:14:00]
just walking in and looking to see if the books are there and going oh good the books are here and the kids have them on their desk check for 100% to everybody's happy because ultimately it comes down to you have to use them and use them well so I'm not going to answer the previous question cuz I'm still not really sure what it was but I think they play together so I don't know I did bring these people on their getting Twitchy to answer but I also don't want to tie us up forever so yeah let's go ahead and let's go ahead and hear from them Madam chairman of the board I think you know it's it's a process that when we're looking at high quality instructional materials it's what is inclusive it's not just the curriculum the textbook that's not at all just what it is you know when we look through ped and their definition of high quality instructional materials it's

[01:15:00]
very clear that they're looking specifically at materials that are content-rich fully accessible culturally and linguistically relevant aligned to New Mexico standards written with clear purpose effective lesson plan structure and pacing to provide the learning styles of all students that encourage increase and curiosity and so that comes with form you know it could be a textbook it could be digital materials and assessments and videos any type of interactive Technologies and so I think it's important that when we look at teachers having a strong viable curriculum in the classroom when as a district were saying that we the state is vetting materials from all of these providers they're giving us a country to choose from and they are rating them and District

[01:16:00]
have the opportunity to look and see what you know what's going to work best for the district and so our goal is to make sure that our teachers have everything that they need to do their job well to feel successful because when they do our kids do and with that when we're looking when we're looking for a monitoring you know opportunity to go in in the walk through process it's it's that if a teacher is teacher should be scaffolding as word you know scaffolding and introducing you know something on Monday I may not be getting to that level of rigor until Thursday however there are essential questions that are we start lessons off with that get kids thinking critically a different higher levels and so if teachers are using the high quality instructional materials and are collaborating

[01:17:00]
with each other and lesson planning together like it's outrageous what could happen I mean I wish when I looked at the materials with the Odell adoption as a high school English teacher I got you know giddy about it because if I had those materials when I was a teacher in the classroom wow what me and my colleagues could have done and so that's I think really important to recognize is that it's not going in and checking the box to say yes there are you know teachers are obeying us it's not about that it's about the collaboration between all of us we are all the district I know administrators are called the District but teachers stop we are all the District board members and we need to create a more collaborative approach to what is happening in our classrooms and I think that this is a really strong way to go about that and we are really emphasizing the need for teachers to be interacting in this

[01:18:00]
does at a greater depth and they did at the high school level and they're really excited about this about their new HQ items and so I think we need to look at it as a asset versus a deficit are there any other questions respond directly to the the validity point in that we use the data that we had and it if you can kind of what's superintendent mentioned is we are going to be creating our own process so that in the future you'll be able to answer those questions with more detail so it's that's what we had starting point it was not incongruous with what our academic folks were seeing in there but we will be

[01:19:00]
I'm trying not to be able to answer for details about the technicalities of it go ahead so that actually got two directly what my question was so can I ask a follow-up question about who and how that will be developed Madden president member Peterson building off of the system the superintendent describe to the beginning in regards to school teams going in building the culture District teams going in giving feedback we have those systems in place on practice is perfect and it's going to take practice for everybody to kind of get the hang of this new instrument this new methodology these new look force that were using because

[01:20:00]
we've done this we have that culture we have that reciprocal communication with district and school teams but as we do this monthly with our schools we're going to build that capacity as we look at high-quality instructional materials and grade level tasks in 3.2 so procuring that instrument is going to help us get to that next step what I want to say is this point in time is going to really be just that but we're going to continue the work on a week to week month-to-month basis and we have another system that's worth mentioning in the supporting of quality teaching and really working together with our partners to be with our teacher Partners to be able to really look at these protocols the systems the way we do walk through the way we talk to each other the way we provide the support what's working what's not how can we improve because the left hand needs to know what the right hand is doing and when you need to support each other

[01:21:00]
as we go in and look for these important look for us because this is the charge this is what we want to improve upon and with our systems people working towards those goals we're confident that we'll see an increase in these areas thank you I appreciate all those responses all right I want to take a time out really quick because this so at this point so the the questions so the questions in the conversation is very robust but it is off track so I want to remind you that we are looking in Reverse we're looking we're playing back the tape we don't have crystal balls sitting in front of us you can't monitor what's you can't monitor the future so we really we really have to keep keep the the learning from what the data has

[01:22:00]
hold us into perspective for this portion of the monitoring session towards the end there it is appropriate at the end of the monitoring session to ask a couple of questions that are more future-focused about the next steps and this is this is always the challenge so don't so don't feel bad about it but we do need to redirect our reorient ourselves to replaying the video versus talking about what's going to happen in the future and with that I am so I want to let you know what my process is on this side so as you're asking questions I am recording them and I am actually preparing a coaching document that I will send out to the board afterwards that is shared in the spirit of continuous Improvement and while I'm not giving real-time coaching to the administration I also have

[01:23:00]
you have some coaching notes for the administration as well and I promise they're all positive all right who will be the next victim I mean board member so in this 3.1 there was a mention of sreb and then the data that we're looking at is for a tuned and so my question is looking at the data that the 30% that we're looking at and the mention of SRE b reviews they were both looking at curriculum and instruction did they find did SRE B and attuned find similar observations across the district and did they find anything that was different

[01:24:00]
so I want to lift up something so thank you you address specifically where which data in the report you're referring to and when I refer to data in the report that can be the hard numerical numerical data the quantitative data and it can also be the qualitative data the observation the next steps so it's when I refer to data I'm talking about the information included within the report so thank you for for one pointing out exactly which information you're referring to and that's going to be helpful for your community as they watch along but and also for your staff members so that they know exact

[01:25:00]
play what you're referring to these are great practices that help you eliminate ambiguity from the conversation so great job inside of the question there was one thing so asking so you want to keep your questions focused on what is included in the report versus referring to asking about what is not included in the report or what is separate from the report the Assumption should always be that what is in the report is what is being reported and anything that is not is either irrelevant or detracts from the strategies for moving forward so great job framing the question but we want to keep the question focused on what is actually included in in the information that's being presented

[01:26:00]
so my question to you is was there anything that wasn't included in the report that you referred to well I think the only thing that wasn't referred to was a hard number from sreb but the fact that sreb was mentioned in the report as to a curriculum and instruction review that they have used I feel that it is a valid set of inquiry that's fair a lot of people Jackson

[01:27:00]
visit in the methodology used is different than the observation tool that yielded the 30% so there weren't necessarily looking for the same thing however I think it's fair to say that there was likely some similar bindings but the interesting thing and the exciting thing quite frankly about the sreb reviews and the reports that were generated for each school is that they are specific to the school and the yield District wide Trends I will give you an appetizer for next month several of them had to do with College and Career Readiness which has to do with go through and that is the topic for next month it seems and this is not a question this is just a comment it does seem like you have a lot of tools available to use

[01:28:00]
and that they are offering up some good sets of data to be able to implement the goals in the guardrails so I think that's really cool and Madam chair and board member Jackson to just be a little specific with it be attuned diagnostic was a district wide snapshot for all levels where SRB curriculum reviews or school specific snapshots for middle schools only so yes as Dr Gonzalez stated to find thematic similarities we can we can do but it wouldn't be fair to do it's not apples to oranges I think I have before you have the follow-up question I want to I said I wasn't going to but I am going to celebrate your staff for a minute because they just did something

[01:29:00]
play special they didn't have so they took what you asked which does it have a specific answer but they added Clarity to why that answer doesn't exist and they informed you of what the what the actual details are around it that is an excellent job more information is always helpful as long as it's in the spirit of deepening the understanding yeah yeah I agree I think are you okay any other I don't think it's I think it's not a good strategic question at the 30% and like remember Peterson I have a hard time believing

[01:30:00]
but what I'm looking for in the data is what kind of you know what are the strengths of in a 30% or what are the struggles what gaps are existing maybe between maybe an elementary school they are teaching more at grade level than they are at middle school high school and I think that's just missing here to kind of you know I'm looking at that number but I have no idea that honestly what it means when it comes to the different levels elementary middle school and high school and maybe that's not something that should be here but right away what I want to see is like oh where are we missing are we missing you know having grade level because maybe it's a certain

[01:31:00]
so I know that's not probably a really good question but that's what when I'm looking at this I'm not really getting you know that much from it besides the 30% that I personally don't believe but that's okay yeah Peggy so that question actually isn't as bad as is your you're telling yourself that it is thank you so you did a couple of things here that were very very good so again you address exactly which data you're referring to and then you your question so there was you said a lot in there but the question that you asked actually so what are the strings or the struggles that you've learned from this from this number that that actually is exactly what we want you to ask what do you what are you learning from the data that that we're looking at

[01:32:00]
I want to caution board members from providing a lot of so every with each clarification and and like justification of the question it it opens the floor for for you to get off track with the with the monitoring session and to go down different rabbit holes and different and it also opens up the conversation for board members to begin giving opinions and suggesting strategies and that's something we certainly want to avoid but the asking the question like what are what are the strengths and what are the the difficulties that you've learned about this and even going deeper and you know

[01:33:00]
how do we how do we I think this is actually been asked quite a bit so the question about how the magnitude of what has what has been studied or what has the data that has been captured I feel like that's something that has been addressed pretty pretty thoroughly so far but going into you know what what are the additional the strengths that we can that we can see in these numbers that's excellent thank you that was the question that I had written down see I have it right here I have proof that I wrote it down thank you are they allowed to answer yes so I think I'll pass my colleagues for the other question

[01:34:00]
but with respect to the breakdown between elementary middle and high school the data that we had it's more of a technical question and that the data we have available does not make that break down available to us it might be something that Administration looks at kind of internally for future for future decision-making but in this particular monitoring part that they have is not available with respect to what we learned from the 30% and abroad but I'll I can toss it over to my books on my left if they'd like yes that would be you know what would what did we learn from the 30% I think specifically for this interim guardrail is again making sure that our teachers have the materials that they need to to do what they need to do in the classroom for our kids and we pulled it

[01:35:00]
play from from the diagnostic report so more importantly I think is also the need for the professional development around the materials so that came out in the illustrative mathematics it's hard you know it's a tough curriculum and so we need to support teachers so not only do we give them materials and here's a book go forth and teach them up but we say here's how you can use this most effectively as well so that's probably the areas of growth for us and what it did with the number if nothing else is it made us really look at what kind of materials do we have why are they being used if that's what's happening and why are some people use it so it created a different context to conversations that I think is useful on that is more important than the number itself is it's a target people want to know what it means people want to know how we came to that number and people want to know on a very human

[01:36:00]
how they can do better though it's bird that conversation at the table at the district and school level because help me understand what this is help me understand how this was measured help me understand how we can do better tomorrow than we did today at a very fundamental level I think this bird that conversation okay any other do you have a question I'm not going to ask a question but to think of asking a question I'm just going to tell you like I feel like you supported everything that you said like you got to the nitty-gritty of why it wasn't and you were honest and transparent with us and when we receive data like that that's how we're able to move forward and actually receive the outcomes that we're looking for so thank you any other questions I I do not have a question because

[01:37:00]
Peggy asked my question in relationship to this card bill because it was I had just you know I had the same I had the same question just what do we need to know about this particular data point what were our strengths or the challenges with it so thank you answered that so I think we can move on to the next guardrail so we'll go on to 3.2% and I wait before we do that I think we have to ask the three questions around the evidence on this one is it it's got all of those pieces that we said it would have I think it defines it tells us what guardrail is there any evidence any of you have any evidence that it does not meet some of the criteria and superintendent and showing now so we don't have to read it all receive did it very quickly

[01:38:00]
that's great thank you so I think just on a technicality because Ashley's probably going to say this it doesn't have the the two data points it doesn't have the data from before but we've already addressed why that is so and I think we were going to hear the tadam moment in terms of on track or off track so I think we're ready to go ahead and just have you present on the guardrail very good well this is guardrail 3.22% of observed classrooms using grade level standard student work will increase from 38% in August of 2023 to 70 in May of 2026 Source was again the organizational diagnostic that was done in 2023 so that's where that starting number almost 40% of classes just to highlight and actually I'm glad I don't have to read this because a lot of it is tied to what we read on the

[01:39:00]
first and what's going well we already have a walk-through system we already have people that are trained we already have a culture of accepting that we've done work with the middle schools but what's a little different and this one is the elementary school principals in this particular area so 51 of the elementary school principals participated in the University of Washington cohort focused on providing Effective Teacher feedback and this year all elementary principals will participate in the University of Washington Court focused on providing this was all part of the principal Leadership Academy we began a year and a half ago so this is a this is some of the work that you have agreed to find and I really think you see why it's going to be valuable English so we're doing a little better

[01:40:00]
this is a big one for me and I'm glad we included this so when back in the day when they rolled out the Common Core State Standards we really dove into training around those things and we did a lot and we gave teachers opportunities to talk about it we looked at them and their apps you could utilize I remember being in a training and just being amazed at what you can pull up on this new mysterious technology device and it's overwhelming there's there's a lot there and so we did that for a few years and then it just stopped and the Assumption was one that everybody got it and two that was continuing to do that type of work it is our understanding now that does something like that but may not be as in depth and so it's a lot of what I keep referring to at the state level and when I have these conversations

[01:41:00]
yes we do a lot of retreat reteaching and retraining and catching people up we stopped doing this because we felt we didn't need to and now we're beginning to wonder if maybe that scenario that we need to refocus on as far as what are the core standards what really has to be taught one of the things that we did during the pandemic that I think was really important is we identified what we call the central standards recognizing that learning was going to be stunted the online learning was going to be tough we tried to get down to make sure they know these five six whatever his standards I can continue to Advocate at the public education department that we have to consider doing that as a state really look at what are the key skills students need but anyways as far as this goes we understand we probably need to pick up some some special around this area and that's a great opportunity for us to work with our practitioners because they can really help us to understand what where it needs to be picked up and quite frankly we have some that could probably offer

[01:42:00]
so we've got opportunities here we do have to define rigorous instruction a little better I think it's similar to other things people know it when they see it but you know they're not always sure if that's it so Barbara got it anyway so you know our students again requested more challenging instructional tasks that we thought was interesting we are seeing a number of increased opt-outs for the English language development services you did hear a potential explanation for that today and public forum there is I believe inconsistent understanding of the difference between bilingual and English language development services because they are not the same and people do get them confused and then when we launched tutor Elizabeth to be awarded for the

[01:43:00]
element around what's excellent instruction for English language arts what's salmon mathematics and the development of a district-wide instructional framework and then really super important Scopes and sequences units of study so for years we had those and then they sort of disappeared into the I don't know the either it is my understanding that we have found them again but they're a little out of date they need to be re-upped so that's I believe this is the work that's going to be done in in the strength and quality and teaching the work with the teachers and that's where our practitioners are really going to have an opportunity to engage in this really important work I really think if we have consistent scope and sequence across the district it would help us dramatically because teachers don't understand I need to get from point A to point x z by the end of the year and here's the pattern and timing of those sort of things so that's what it works with everybody be exactly on it no because again

[01:44:00]
how to modify but you understand where you got to get using this newly developed District definition for rigorous construction as a guide for future professional development to improve student outcomes this next year first and second year principals will participate in standards-based instruction professional development to support challenging grade level instructional tasks so again helping our leaders the people who are supposed to be the primary teachers in the schools help support their teachers well by understanding what they can do try to develop a system to decrease the number of opt-outs if that's needed and then I think again we talked about it providing Clarity to teachers to better understand the difference between English language development much more complete implementation of the paper tutoring program for students in grades 3

[01:45:00]
guardrail 3.2 and we're open for questions okay Ashley do you want to say anything before we go to questions whoever is ready to go first can go on so we're talking about do you want to ask a question no okay don't have a question you have a question I can tell I have to say and this is actually a and I and I appreciate it statement that this really is dance and every time I've read it something else is jumped out at me of paid attention to that earlier so this is this is a question

[01:46:00]
should have been a technical question earlier on but I'll go ahead and ask it since I've got it in regards to the very first step of of what are we going to do next and the and the request for proposal how how can that align with the work that's been done previously by teachers and by knowledgeable staff in the district to to really look at the standards line them with practice deep and understanding to be able to actually use them effectively in classroom instruction that can exist that will include practitioner Peterson

[01:47:00]
describe the first agenda of our first convening of the sporting quality teaching on meeting which is taking place in a couple of weeks we are taking out the units of study that are acknowledged outdated they need to be updated in the different areas that will inform the request for the RFP to be able to move forward accordingly but we hope to do that in collaboration and we are under no illusions that it will be quick work it will be delivering intentional work but we recognize it as an area of Need for us to move forward to hit the mark and specifically modified that in some way that would have made it better so that that actually is I would say that that is a strategic question your you are

[01:48:00]
not asking about the you're not asking about understanding the data you're not asking who is measured you're actually referring to one of the strategies that they have that they have addressed so that is completely appropriate my only feedback is that I would try to focus it try to focus it backwards so go back to which is hard to do when you're talking about next steps but it's also not entirely forward-looking because you're talking about the work that has already been done so I would just flip the question around so what do we know about or so what do we know about work that has previously been done by the educational experts in our district the teachers the principals all of the people and how can the RFP that you have lined out in the first step moving forward be

[01:49:00]
quit that that was a great job thank you for the answer to any other questions I have a question can I go ahead I think for me it's it's it's it's on the on what's not going well and it you've mentioned the English language development services and the opt-outs and so for me it was like what what more do we know about these students that are mentioned in the report because we say it's not going well it's something we have to work on so I was just want to know what do we know more about that what do we know about those students yeah I mean so we know it is it for me I'm trying to understand what it means to have them opt out of what the challenge

[01:50:00]
what does it mean for them it means that they have chosen to not take advantage of the development classes and they'll go into just general education classes and sometimes it may be a family that has a family member at home who speaks a second language and sort of you know cavaliere on the registration for me oh this is this is you know because it is but the child may not really be deeply engaged in that language and so the they get identified because it's on the registration card so they may choose to opt out of those Services I think there's others who have other reasons for opting out and I that I'm speaking only anecdotally here and I'm a little out of date because this has been since I was

[01:51:00]
principal and we had the same issue then I just had families who you know for example a Native American Family might become identified because of perhaps the assessment but they don't really feel they need English language development and so they'll they'll step out and they'll go into a general education class and maybe struggle but often times they do fine as well so I guess my question was really more about but what do we know about them in terms of just as a as a subgroup I mean are they graduating on time or they struggling that's the part or we don't have data on that I do have data on that and that opportunity to think about it beforehand we probably could have brought that but it's something will have to look into my gut is we don't have available we can just jump on Saturday so

[01:52:00]
play feedback yes so so this is so this is kind of bordering on the coaching that I shared with Courtney earlier about things that are not included on the report but it's it's borderline because and this is something that is it is part of the growth it is part of the growth that every single District that begins progress monitoring has to go through and that is finding the balance of how much information to include in the report and so the the coaching that your staff has received is to keep it keep it clear and concise and so part of the give and take that happens prior to the meeting is when when their issues so when they're pieces of information included like this where there could be additional information or where the board could

[01:53:00]
benefit from having having more detail that's that's a great place to have those conversations before the board meeting because that that leads to more robust conversations during the board meeting there enough and and that's I mean so for the purposes of tonight this is this is perfect this is actually a great conversation any other questions board member to me is looks like she wants to ask a question and it has to do with the bullet point just below the opt out the discussion we just had and I'm trying to formulate the question provide so the bullet point reads provide Clarity to teachers to better understand the difference between bilingual and English

[01:54:00]
which development services and so how has this been a problem that we are trying to how has this impacted bilingual and English language development students that we are placing it on next steps conversation with presidential Cordova so navigating the full report so you have

[01:55:00]
what's the section that's titled says on page 3 what's not what are we going to do next step something just happened with my with my sound can you hear me okay now we can yes ok Google of the difference between bilingual and English language development services so that was the the area where they said this is this is not working and there are and then you were referred to for virgin virgin

[01:56:00]
so the the question was is it a is it a problem so it's something that they they identified as as a problem in the OR is what's not working so is there something else that you're trying to that you're trying to understand I'm trying to recapture it I ended up asking a how okay what strategies might be utilized in providing that Clarity is that what you're trying to understand she said yes okay perfect then that's it so you can answer

[01:57:00]
waiting for the queue remember Dominguez members of the board we appreciate the conversation because it helps us also recognize the need for us to perhaps be clear in the Bullet Silver communicating what it is we mean essentially what I think it boils down to is including families in the bullens so not only teachers but families but I think that's a Clarity Point that's absolutely well taken the other thing that I like to listen to the conversation is the notion of coordination of service so when you have an Aldi student for example they are they receive a level based on their access score which puts them in a course best student may or may not be enrolled in a bilingual program around enrichment of the curriculum so that really is an important distinction to really look at from a

[01:58:00]
class schedule placement point of view as well as a support to the student as they receive instruction within the context of their class schedule so that's a distinction that's really important you oftentimes you have students who may be receiving ELD into a language programs that's not a hard and fast rule it's not always the case so really helping our teachers our parents understand the distinction the opportunity to grow in a second language and acquire Proficiency in that second language there's some counseling at some support that I think we as a district can lead to both groups the parents and the teachers around really specifically supporting that student it leaves us with questions I know for me it does

[01:59:00]
that's a learning piece that has nothing to do with this report good to hear that family that you recognize that family and instructors Educators and so I kind of want to understand what what other strategies are in place that you have in place to overcome maybe the challenges that came with that inconsistent launch of paper

[02:00:00]
besides I think you said complete implementation but you have other strategies yes Madam chair and board member Mueller article and consistent launch it was because we had to navigate SB 128 and that has to do with background checks and so we had to work with paper to have them do all their tutors conduct 3,000 APS background checks that took a lot of time because of House Bill 128 I mean Senate Bill 128 so when we look at that it was a slow and soft launch because of the logistical pieces but now kids and teachers have access to it but we they got access to at the end of last school year when which was just not

[02:01:00]
ideal whatsoever however now schools and teachers are being trained on how to utilize it and we are hearing a lot of positive feedback from teachers and principals regarding other utilizing in their classroom how English teachers and history teachers are having their students submit their writing samples for a first review through the tutor the paper review process it's turned around within 24 hours to students so it minimizes the work of teachers having to go line by line for 160 essays which gives students that immediate feedback which is really helpful they also have math math missions which are different math engaging math activities for grade level that can be utilized and teachers are utilizing that

[02:02:00]
call group setting in their classroom so kids can then ask those questions we're seeing a greater impact at the middle school level right now which is really exciting because that's where we see a lot of disengagement so right now we have we're launching people are trained or in the process of being trained and and it's being utilized so it's really exciting today it was a struggle okay I see actually smiling so I don't think she's got any that was a great day I was just going to I was just going to add some very this question is very similar to the question that board member of Domingos asked it was phrase differently but it was getting to the heart of the same thing so there was an identified what's not going well and then

[02:03:00]
how far is a direct response to what are we going to do about it and really this the question that you asked at board member Mueller Aragon is how what are the what are the actual strategies that are going to be used so again this is just another example of adding providing additional depth either in riding on the report or through the verbal presentation questions I think we're all you're asked out Romero I feel like between what you guys presented to us and the answers to the questions that we sent in Pryor I mean I feel as though you understand what the issue is and you understand how to move forward so

[02:04:00]
I'm impressed I mean I'm impressed with this presentation yeah I'm in the same spot I don't have any questions any further questions so any other further questions from anybody else are we good I think we can move on to the next guardrail so the next one is 3.3 same questions any evidence folks have I think other than the the original ones that we had right I mean it's clear we know what it is this is the one on the percentage of classroom teachers rated is innovating in their use of differentiation techniques will increase from 40 percent to 70% we've got a timeline this one says it's on track and we've got one data point and that's where we are and you

[02:05:00]
any other questions or concerns so far on that part if not we could just go on to the presentation I think we'll just move into the presentation Madam president of the board so we come to interim guardrail 3.3 the one that makes us the most nervous and I want to explain why so in Elevate New Mexico the evaluation system for teachers there are four tiers that teacher can be rated at the level one would be not demonstrating two would be developing third is applying and then the highest rating is innovating so what we're shooting for here is that we're going to see a significant increase if you were to do a bell curve it would say that that's 70% is not possible that's just not how it normally works but the goal here is to

[02:06:00]
Friday really support teachers that they can become great teachers good and and anyway so that's what a little nervous about the number right so specific to this one as we get to what we're talking about is that it's the percentage of classroom teachers of differentiation techniques so it's not their overall super scores but specific to different things that will increase from 40% to 70% this is this is one of the hardest things to do this is it's tough differently but it doesn't always and so this could this is a tricky one but we're we're interested in seeing where it goes and it's something that we measure already so that was why it was

[02:07:00]
that the tool has already been utilized within the district with Fidelity and there's ongoing training opportunities ongoing for evaluators around calibration and making sure it's consistently used all principles have been trained in the car Change Model I think the key element here is that we need to create a sense of urgency and that it is about forming coalitions it's not about going out and catching people it's about forming coalitions to make sure we provide the support and Empower employees for Action so that we can have some wins and then trying to consolidate those gains and strengthening change by anchoring this in the culture it's going to be hard but it's it's a really good place to think about how we help people and support them again we purchase materials we are looking at

[02:08:00]
iStation already personalized instruction for all students who performing below grade level there are 23 middle schools that will participate in Lexia power up which is a literacy intervention that they can use during their tier one instruction and again we know that newly enrolled students to the district are assessed for English language fluency within 30 days of registration and then students in dual language programs are assessed with the stamp assessment measuring Reading Writing speaking in oral fluency things to improve so we have provided training around tier 2 interventions but I don't think we have a tool box that we could point to our teachers and say these are the most effective to use and so the ones who are good at it they've got good tier 2 instructions interventions and the people who struggle don't and there's no real way for those groups to come together and and and and build that

[02:09:00]
Remains the primary modality of instruction look there's a time and a place for lecture that's nothing wrong with it but it can't just be all day long all period there's got to be a mixture and we know that these young kids especially this generation Alpha that's coming up and I their man they don't have the attention span that they used to and you can't just talk to him all day and expect them to be little vessels and build up you got to have activity you've got to have movement you've got to have things for them to do and you know what I see I was out at a school today in elementary school and it was so much fun because they're still learning this is how we do school and I was in some of the earlier grades and the kids got real excited when I came in they had no idea who I was on so I had to be somebody and they started getting the teachers had to do little redirected you know to get them back and focused and the ones that were really good at it it was so much fun to see

[02:10:00]
we haven't even been here 2 weeks and they got them you know they've got it this is good it was really good but we need to make sure that that's happening across the way that we get out of that whole group instruction and then we do have a concern about the sap process which is continues to yield a high number of students being placed into special education services what's that really should do is provide a series of interventions for kids to try to keep them out of special education to try to figure out a way to improve them and not especially education really need to be the The Last Resort so we're trying to work on that again so what we're going to do next really look at how do we adopt some District wide tear to interventions that we can point to and say these are good and provide support for teachers to learn how to use them we are establishing a cross-departmental plan for support and professional development around differentiated instruction it can't just be special education trying to help us it's got to be curriculum

[02:11:00]
interventions for language speakers may be different than interventions for struggling readers and so there's got to be this cross-departmental work and then can training continue training and support for personnel involved in the Student Assistance team again we're trying to avoid the over identification of students for special education and make sure that those students are in there really need to be in there and get support they they need and hopefully ultimately get out the problem is I think the special education is it's all too often it's it's it's it's a life sentence and maybe it doesn't need to be so and I have seen programs or kids got out and it's been okay so I think that's what we're trying to get to so those that's 3.3 we stand for questions okay open it up who wants to be brave to ask the first question

[02:12:00]
innovating being at the highest level I didn't know we had the four different ones so just bear with me how and I know we're trying to get him at the highest do you see the majority at 1 2 or 3 cuz obviously we're not at 4 where the majority of of them are teachers were we ranking is that a fair question actually just keep nodding yes that is a perfect question majority of teachers in three with the I mean you saw the percentage of 40 right now and and so most of our teachers are doing a good job you know it's the ones that we don't see much It's tricky to move from 3 to 4 there's just a lot of it's a lot harder the way that the the the the the valuation is established but again it's

[02:13:00]
reminded me really just looking at that one element differentiation which should make it a little easier on our instructors so it's not just your whole life is you know it's can I be rated around differentiation and can I improve their but most of our instructors in that 3 and 4:00 could you tell us again we can provide you you know examples of what we look for what the state asks us to look for in these in these elements

[02:14:00]
right before Ashley do you want anything to add to that or can we move to our next question we can move on remember Peterson looks like you have a question oh I just have to say set our sights High I remember Brad Allison saying that we were going to get 100% of our children above the 50th percentile so period so what obstacles are being encountered with professional time in being able to pull I mean I think the next steps are very appropriate and right on I mean I'm excited to see

[02:15:00]
get into it more I'm I'm hoping that it'll be interesting to see how for instance the conversation around root causes develops and gets intertwined with this as we get into the work more and I'm looking forward to that but right now in terms of really looking at the challenges that we may or may not have what you are seeing over I'll try to look backwards over the last you know beginning implementation the end of last year now looking at this year what's happening with everything from schedule to so before he answered I just want to say again

[02:16:00]
backward facing before you even put a time frame up so good job so I think what we're going to struggle with is the time and you mentioned the schedule so earlier tonight in public forum it came up that the high school schedule doesn't seem to have as much professional development as the elementary level well the reason for that is in the high school schedule they have built-in PD they have a PLC right so that they didn't require as many hours outside of the school day but the Elementary's did so we're going to have to be pretty thoughtful in our use of that time and honestly we won't get to everything this year this is a five year plan it's going to take some time but these are elements and recognizing as we have to start sequencing out what gets the priority now and then what gets priority next year and again how do you

[02:17:00]
I can't be just one time okay now you know how to differentiate bye we're going to have to follow up and make sure that people have access to materials now one of the cool things that we have now of course is all this technology and all this video technology and you know I'm actually taking a course on conservatorship I'm having to take care of a family member and all my training is online and where I'm really thankful is when I have to start filling out the forms actually and go back and look and see what I forgot and you know make sure you don't miss something I know teachers don't have a tremendous amount of time to do that but at least I'm hoping it will be able to provide options for them so that if they do need to go back and look those options will be available to them much more easily than you know go back and look at what notes you took that one day but it's going to take some collaboration with with our people to try to figure out how to do it

[02:18:00]
again I am 100% convinced because I have seen it I have people in this District that can teach us I don't always need to go outside and hire someone you know we talked about the RFP earlier for help with those visions of excellence and those those those those those those scope and sequences we could do it we just don't have the time and the people we need somebody to come in and guide those groups and help them work through it because we're doing all this other stuff so that's what we're trying to be real careful with how we use our PD time and RPD money so we can make sure we can support some of the initiatives and then we bring in help when we need it thank you just help me to understand so what would that be tactical so this looking at the date of the

[02:19:00]
40% of our classroom teachers right now are rated innovating symptoms of differentiation specifically okay that was my follow-up question so 40% specifically in terms of differentiation okay and so what what you guys are hoping to move the needle on is that tier 2 instruction which is specifically the differentiation aspect okay it would also include the ability to interview Tuesday and quickly

[02:20:00]
again that's where the art of teaching where a kid struggling to understand and you work with them for 3 minutes and oh I get it now that was an intervention that's differentiating cuz you taught him a little differently and it's up to us to notice that okay yeah I think I'm seeing this totality of the guardrails of how you set these up in it that's not a question a statement I know but I appreciate it because now I'm seeing the the totality of your starting with your one with the instructional material then you're going to the school work and then you're going to the differentiation and those combined will move the needle is what you're looking for okay well that actually goes back to the question I think it was asked earlier so what is this element show me that element shows you that element but when you're done looking at all three elements you've got a much more comprehensive picture of what's actually

[02:21:00]
which is fine because otherwise this conversation which is difficult already would just be that much more difficult and we would swim around on because we I got all sorts of jargon you know and we can we can train you up if you want but this way it's much more concise I think and clear for us in terms of how we report to you yeah oh absolutely I mean I I wrote I wrote down give her you have Elevate you have SRB you have stamp you have mlss you have the University of Washington you have all of them so many Tools in your toolbox so I appreciate that you're focusing in on specific tasks that will move the needle forward and just one other question if it's okay I think we're just going to have any questions or

[02:22:00]
is the future looking question but are there any changes that might that you anticipate coming up in the future through any budget recommendations that you have or any policy changes that you foresee coming to the board with like will they will will there be any budget implications or policy recommendations based on these changes well so that's a good future question obviously it's going to get tricky because for example Academy is fully funded by Usher that goes away both continue to have principal meetings and will continue to work with them and we'll try to build off the work that's been presented to us from these outside agencies that are getting

[02:23:00]
the good training I think it will be at the casino at the state because they're trying to start their own principal Leadership Academy and they're doing fine but they're they need some direction and we may end up helping or at least offering to provide some thoughts on that we may need to review the policy around the identification of you know second language speakers maybe there's some you know maybe there's there's some ways we could get to a point where parents to instructional materials they don't they just don't and it's year after year after year and that adds up so we're always short the materials and part of that is so what do you do do you buy the materials for everybody and you have to cut back on the PD

[02:24:00]
or do you buy the materials for some of the people and they get the PD but the other people are stuck in the old books right and then you try to catch it up so that's the the balance and that's something that will come up in the future for you all to discuss and decide how you know whatever future Administration brings forward a plan that's kind of what they're going to be talking about I think they're going to be looking for what do you want us to fund so and just to clarify they mean the state state who doesn't adequately fund the state does not have instructions I think you saw the list this past year of all the items that got included in the scg and they said it properly in many cases they did but I start to run into issues for example the

[02:25:00]
menstrual products were put into the scg you have to pay menstrual products okay will you estimate a cost on that right so what happens when you run out of products is if you estimate it under okay we had some concerns about the funding for the EA's and whether or not they really adequately loaded that we don't believe they did and the problem with these these funding formulas they just keep sticking it into one general fund and so it's real hard to say well there was this much and they'll tell you you should have this much for instructional materials okay we can pull that much for instructional materials but that might have an impact on other areas because it's not lying by line by line that they say here's your instructions it sounds like they need to be more Innovative in their differentiation

[02:26:00]
it has been in the past and I don't want to sound like I'm just flapping away at people but it's just been a long long time that we've been short funded out of materials that was a classroom teacher in the 90s wow how can that be and it just kind of adds up each year it just it just sort of becomes kind of like when we look at children and you know gaps it just the Gap just keeps getting bigger and bigger so can I wrap it up with one final shirt and it kind of goes back to the little motto we learned in our session while back where it says like with your hard work and our support you know overall like what can the board help support you in the next steps

[02:27:00]
what do you need from us Dr Bowman here's a sense of urgency will do it over the next few years I do think you're going to start in the infrastructure but you got to give us time to show that and and collect more this year and and we'll see which way and be patient when we have a because maybe we did something wrong or just didn't work as well

[02:28:00]
start the training was brilliant and the people who took the training had a different opinion you know so we'll see I just have something that just kind of popped into my head so when I was looking at you know these these numbers do you see anywhere or have data that shows that there's like a higher level of the use of innovative differentiation techniques in like dual language classrooms we can look at it but we aren't currently we couldn't pull that up period

[02:29:00]
the last bullet points under what is not going well and what are we going to do next steps in reference to over identification of students and special ed and the question is so what system or system strategies have been in place that you will correct to avoid over identification continue training and support but if you could elaborate a little bit so when you look at the use of the model there's two groups that traditionally are trying to push I think towards special ed sometimes it's parents they get very concerned about their child's performance

[02:30:00]
see them falling behind and see special education as sort of a way to solve a lot of their problems it could be just be easier the classes are smaller maybe the curriculum is not as is is is is is difficult and and maybe this will stop you know my kid feeling bad or you know struggling so much and so sometimes they push really hard even when the team that's there is saying we really think that with just a little bit of support that sometimes it's teachers who will try the intervention and it didn't work and go see it so the training is really to make sure that one parents

[02:31:00]
make them more sensitive to the advantages of staying in General Ed because I think sometimes we get really short-sighted I just this is the solution for my kid and you got to help there and then sometimes we have to work with the teachers to make sure that we don't just try and intervention one time or you know we make sure it's being done right I had a teacher I used to work with it at one of the middle schools and I was really trying to get him to do small group work and she really didn't like small group work and we worked on it we worked on it and I came to her class and she did it and the kids started to school around because they'd never done small group in there and she didn't work didn't do anything and I know we had to keep working on that it's the same thing they don't always work the first time give it another shot

[02:32:00]
tell me a lot about behaviors right that that signal to parents or teachers that a child may need to be placed in special ed how much of that would you say was impacted by the pandemic what strategies take that into consideration

[02:33:00]
so that's what I thought she just confirmed that I'm sorry I had to break her ankle to get that information the largest group in special education or students with learning disabilities that's the largest group The behavior disorder kids we're not seeing growth in that population however across the school district we had seen an increase in behaviors but we've been trying to deal with those again through interventions and counseling and support because these are kids who maybe before the pandemic were not demonstrating these extreme behaviors and after that drive them into special education I would argue no I think they can find support other ways now maybe there were some kids who got really really damaged during the pandemic then maybe we would consider that but

[02:34:00]
think they're going to be a smaller percentage than just some kids who need some support and retraining one of the schools I visited in the first week they were out at the playground and the principal said this is so good cuz it's really like it was before that I think they learned how to do school again and and and and and so are their we're getting better is it great now do we have behaviors yes well they continue to be extreme I'm sure but it's improving and what time I think we'll see that really start to really thank you to know okay I want to just do a quick I think we've asked all the questions we can ask on this I'm looking at you I mean I think we've got the questions on the report itself because I think we've got all of our answers to this I didn't have a question because I had submitted my questions and all my questions came back

[02:35:00]
what was clarified that you guys did a great job and I appreciate a board member Jackson you taking it like the levels want to you know looking I hadn't looked at it that way so that that puts it in perspective and it definitely you know underscores for me that there's a strategy across this whole strand that it is not just about the materials but it's really about a number of things that go into how how we get to Improvement towards that and I really appreciate that conversation I learned a lot tonight in terms of that that process in hopefully our you know our staff and our community also here that that's you know that we're looking at this from a very strategic lenses and a very it's it's going to take time but it's all so it's a it's a number of areas in the way that it's kind of stacked makes me makes me really proud of the

[02:36:00]
I really appreciate it so I don't know Ashley if you want to have any other comments to us on this cuz we're going to close this was our monitoring session and we're just going to go on to the rest of our agenda and finish up for the night yep I just have a couple a couple of final comments and then I'm going to let you all go about your business so I want to commend all of you for the energy you brought to the session you know we started a little a little rocky unsure getting everything right by the end of the session I was able to lean back and I really didn't have to provide much coaching at all you guys did an awesome job both from the questioning side and the answer inside and so I have a couple of recommendations for the future for our next practice monitoring session so I think just based

[02:37:00]
really you are a very inquisitive bored and you don't so some boards need a lot of delineation and and their reports need to be kind of compartmentalized to this one this one this one your reports definitely should still remain you know this is the internal 3.142 but in the future I would recommend to get the board feedback on all of the elements present for high quality reports and then here presentation for all of the reports that are being presented that night at once and then go into the questioning so questions for the first one question mark

[02:38:00]
that's just the way they work so great job with all of that I'm going to chat so last time I challenged you all to submit submit questions in advance and you did a wonderful job with that this time I'm going to add a layer on and add a piece to that challenge so once the questions in advance and two I want to ask everyone on the board to provide at least one piece of feedback on the report itself about the level of information that is contained within is that the appropriate level of information do you need more information or is it too much information because sometimes too much information can create a lot of cloudiness so that's my challenge to the board for the next time next month and other than that great job and so are there any

[02:39:00]
men's final questions for me before I move on I don't see any all right thank you all and great job and enjoy the rest of your meeting thank you all right so thank you so much for for sitting here with us today on the board for a while but listening to it from this perspective is me something completely different so I really appreciate it I recognized Dr Gonzalez and his new role so our next item for discussion in action is a pool of the consent agenda so we've got two items on here do I have emotional on this I moved to approve the consent agenda my second

[02:40:00]
this is Josefina all right so the consent agenda items or the revision to board policy GB and revision to board policy I hate we had a first by abortion by secretary Jackson and a second by Josefina Dominguez I have a roll call please hey Amelia Aragon yes and you always I'm sorry Robert Peterson or not last night but our discussion items are a report on update on the right sizing Discussion Group board president vice president Peggy Miller okay and I want to give a big thank you to Dr Albright she put things together here for me so that was very helpful so at our right to Discussion Group there were several topics that were discussed and we had a really good conversation about

[02:41:00]
language programs which included how many schools we have which is 61 the student participation which is over 9,000 we talked to him about bilingual seal data that we saw there was 713 bilingual seals awarded we saw decline somewhat admit in high schools and there was a conversation about the fact that there's a lack of Staff often at schools and so that is one of the reasons that they are not able to offer the bilingual steals we also had a conversation about the native language program Pathways and how important it was to have intentional Pathways for duel language students to College Programs and just bringing those Pathways back we talked about more support for newcomer newcomers as well and we heard something about that at during public forum talked some what about

[02:42:00]
School Staffing at the Dual language program level and how right now they're over 50 50 vacancies and what we see if we end up going to two sides for Coronado is that some of the staff will have to be pulled from other schools in this team to be something that was rather unpopular in order to host a dual language program you need credential teachers which is one of the most important things and some of the factors that hinders school from becoming a language you know do Language School are the needs and the lack of credential teachers though there seem to be a lot that have the credentials but that are choosing not to not to teach in duel language classroom we also discuss the different kinds of program models that are used at schools and the number of e l l students who aren't doing language programs

[02:43:00]
because there's about 13% that choose to opt out we talked about trying to add some public input at the right sizing discussion group meeting so people feel that they're listening to talk to also about the number of students who follow dual language programs from elementary through high school then we turn to quite a lively discussion on the proposal to expand Coronado to a K-8 school right now Coronado is a spotlight school which is kind of like what used to be I guess an a school is what the principal alluded to when it comes to Staffing in Coronado they are they are fully staffed we also talked to someone about Washington Middle School in about Truman Middle School and whether there's

[02:44:00]
capacity for all the Coronado fifth graders to go to those schools for middle school and there is capacity there and Washington Middle Schools also fully staffed as far as transfer Trends in about approximately 10 years there have only been about 13 Coronado students that have gone on to attend Washington Middle School Coronado has an 80/20 dual language program that's how they start at kindergarten first grade and then it goes to 730 and then by 5th grade it is at 5050 talked about the difference between Washington Middle School which is a neighborhood school that feeds to Albuquerque High and the difference with Coronado which is a magnet school that doesn't feed into any middle school or high school and we see that the children at Coronado come from everywhere in the city and one thing that was also pointed out is that the number

[02:45:00]
number of students who attend Coronado that are on free and reduced were on free and reduced lunch is is rather low at only 30% when it comes to servicing students at what if we did have a 4 to 8 4th grade to 8th grade school they would basically service the Coronado students so they would go from preschool to third grade and then from there they would go to the fourth through 8 if that's what would happen at Taft there was also cost benefit analysis that you all can find it's in the packet on page 36 so you can kind of look at that analysis and then when it came to some of the support what we heard is that 60 almost 67% of South

[02:46:00]
in Coronado becoming a K-8 if they're split into two different campuses about 33% of the staff supported two sites and would remain about 17% would remain if they could only stay at the original site and about 6% would leave if they had to go to Taft and 40/44 % were really undecided 50% when it came to families wanted to 36% want to move to Taft and they also go to keep the non boundary magnet without transportation which is a real a real seem to be a real issue for people being able to attend Coronado talk some more about what was offered at other do language schools about the waitlist and vacancies about if we

[02:47:00]
add two Coronado campuses we'd have to add on assistant principal and then also about the distance is over 5 1/2 me between Coronado to Taft middle school so Transportation was was a big issue and so equity and access is is a really big concern because who will have access and it's going to be a lot of the kids that are without transportation or resources are the ones that won't be able to access the school and so some of the follow-up questions is questions were what kind of experiences family transfer to other schools from Coronado and these kids that go to middle school they go all over the city from private schools to to other Charter Schools we also talked about working with government Affairs team maybe on legislation to help reimburse someone for transportation and

[02:48:00]
then at the end of the meeting Mr wege just talked about perhaps what needs to be done is looking at maybe other options for Taft rather than having a 4th through 8th at Taft and our future topics are going to be early childhood CTE and then we're also going to need to discuss very quickly about the Northwest and Southwest boundary changes so that was 2 hour meeting and 5 minutes there's still some work obviously that needs to be done no decisions have been made so it's mostly just as a discussion group we're working through and we're just sort of discussing all of the options that are available in all the concerns before we finalize some places where we need to go on how we're going to move forward you have a question yeah I did well first

[02:49:00]
I'm sure we can get a copy of what okay that would be great so this is all like you guys are going to bring forth a recommendation after all of these discussions okay I guess my question regarding like the the K8 expansion was was that requested by the parents the staff it was requested by the parents okay okay and so yes it was it was a thought brought forward by the parents because they're noting that for them it's that point they don't feel like they have a they don't have an entree into a continued school and they don't because they're coming from all over the district and so some of the things that we learned through this process is that they're not all like in

[02:50:00]
but so they don't necessarily feel like they have a middle school home that's what the parents feel like and we do have families that are coming it's all over the city it's everywhere I mean when we looked at the geomap it's it's everywhere yeah because it's it's it's a magnet school too so there's a there's a difference in that it's cool and so it's and it's a magnet school without a boundary so they basically we can take kids from everywhere and so it's become that so I think we have to have some more conversation about you know what would be some potential next steps that we can do in that but it was a it was a good conversation because we also kind of got an idea of where the district is with just a stool language programs and we also found out through that process

[02:51:00]
maybe go into a middle school that has a dual language program they're not necessarily in the Dual language program that they might get waitlisted there as well because it depends on the number of students the number of classes because our regular middle schools have to run both strands as well they're running in English and a dual language so so there's there's it's complicated and if anything I learned that it's really complicated and we need to be really thoughtful on just we just need to have some more conversation and so I did meet with Dr Blakey today she we had an opportunity to just kind of convene a little bit so we're going to be scheduling she was just trying to get some clarity to like or we going to go next and how are we going to move so meeting is being proposed Peggy for you and I to meet with doctor Blake he could help do some some planning on that so we can figure out how to move

[02:52:00]
can you talk about there's just not if there's 50 vacancies right now what would happen then so it'd be kind of like poaching you know from one school to try to get them at that school and then just some of the programs that just it's called dual language but there may only be like one first grade class that has a dual language teacher so it's not you know a real duel language school I guess what and that's interesting it's interesting I mean and what's really also you know I'm really proud of the fact that we have this we do have this incredible magnet program we do I mean it's an incredible magnet program it's much more immersive you know the 80 you know so so it does have its a great school there's no doubt it's a wonderful school it's a wonderful

[02:53:00]
I'm really proud of our district being the one that's that's got this and so it's making this distinction between a magnet and what a magnet does and what are dual language within our traditional middle schools offers and it's like how do we make all of that work I think that's the key here it's like how do we make it how do we make it work can we make it work and if it goes to a K-8 model what do we need to make it work too yeah and and how do we make it work to ultimately support the goals right I mean if if they're a high-performing school and that is going to help you know support our goals and that's something to ponder as well but I guess this will come to the full board at

[02:54:00]
robust discussion as well not that you haven't had a robust discussion that's not but board member Peterson but it becomes a reality issue because the fact is that the students at Coronado are not the students identified and using Martinez they just start and we can't pretend they are and that in order to continue serving them at the level that they're being served it basically would mean making weaker the do language programs at schools that serve the Martinez students and the schools and there's and the reality is by strengthening Coronado Washington and that is an

[02:55:00]
active reality because of Staffing and so I think that the real challenge in front of us I mean I was hardened by the discussion that we had at the right sizing because I think we really started to address to real critical things is one how do we really strengthen or do a language programs in the need to look at it comprehensively but the other thing is how do we really change the story about our middle schools what do we need to do objectively but also what do we need to do to change the story that's in the community The Narrative about our middle schools that really can push back on on the story that is out there about middle

[02:56:00]
your children and that is that's those are two things that are serious issues for the district that we need to confront and those I think speak very directly to to the goals I have another I'm throwing out a question that we need to ponder I know I think I heard that we have about 50 certified bilingual teachers that don't want to do bilingual programs must so they're more and I have to say we need to look at that I was one of those teachers who took all the credits and then I hit that from my administrator because

[02:57:00]
it was a ton of work and I did not see that it was it did not abide by my standards and I think Mr citizen pointed that out to us at the committee as well turns of changing a differential which they also have upped and increased hoping that it would attract more but but the work level is definitely is definitely a concern and so there's a lot it's very nuanced and it's amazing how in a right sizing conversation this whole thing is become really new ones around doing language and you know what does it mean for this so we kind of went down a rabbit hole on that and we're on this whole issue of you know just right sizing at campus or the really issue is what do we do with Taft and that that particular facility so I

[02:58:00]
I think we're going to have to come back and in a kind of remember what's the task in front of us and and look at that because I think it's you know it would definitely could go in in many directions but it's been really helpful I think it's been very thoughtful I really appreciated The Advocates that have been on both sides because we had a chance to listen to parents who are currently Coronado and don't you know haven't been successful in transitioning into a middle school and having parents who are at our middle schools that have had a successful transition into their and you know we're at Coronado so it's it's really a balancing act and kudos to Dr Blakey and the team who are trying to to kind of Corrales and to into a thoughtful conversation so that we can look at it in on Monday all right any other questions comments okay we'll move on to our next item which is an

[02:59:00]
update on the community engagement ad hoc committee and this is members Courtney Jackson and Josefina Dominguez okay all right so yeah really cool things are happening so the invites went out for the the dinner and the VIP breakfast in the summit and hopefully everybody received those if you specifically added invites to that list will you please just reach out to the people because I am hearing that some went into spam so just reach out but what is really cool is that so far to date or the for the dinner we have 43 people who have rsvp'd for the dinner for the breakfast we have 26 who have rsvp'd for that and that includes 11 out of town guests so we do have people flying in from all literally all over the country to come to the summit

[03:00:00]
good to hear about our community goals guardrails and strategic plan and for the summit we have 84 people signed up so far and there's still two weeks to go so that is really exciting let's see so I think we are I won't go into the details but there's been a lot of work done on the board Services side so I do want to just think again I want to think Johanna and Christy and Shannon for all the help that they've given to to get that together so please check your your invites and and make sure that the people that you added to that list get invited moving on to the more the bigger task of this community engagement committee some of the current plans that we have

[03:01:00]
for the fall Community engagement event that is scheduled right now tentatively for October 16th to November 13th and we're going to repeat the quadrants structure that was done last year so it's just kind of to go back out and and touch touch those areas again and again it's to follow up we asked you what you what your vision and values were we've created goals and guardrails and now we're going back out to to talk to you about that so that is one event that that's a big engagement event that we that that is in the planning process some of the things that we still do need to plan we will we're still working on we're going to have a 2-year calendar there will be a aspects to this that will revolve around the superintendent search and

[03:02:00]
we are currently collecting and this is where the board can certainly help we are currently currently collecting other ideas for engagement and Outreach and the committee has started a spreadsheet or a list of some ideas but what and I'll throw some of those out to you but what I would like to ask is if you have an idea of a good engagement or something that you'd like us to add to the list to discuss please let myself or board member Dominguez know before next Tuesday some of the ideas are to have a board meeting once a month but is solely dedicated to community outreach maybe have Community engagement events that are by education level Elementary Middle High School maybe three per quarter an idea was the board members could go out and canvas door to door could just go knock on doors in your

[03:03:00]
some other ideas is that maybe the maybe the community engagement events follow the progress monitoring calendar or maybe we do virtual events that are hosted by each board member so those are just some ideas of Engagement if you have any ideas please let us know we are meeting next August or August 22nd is our next meeting where we will make sure that we have finalized everything for this Summit and then we will definitely have a full plan to present to the board by the end of September with community outreach which is different than Community engagement Community engagement is on our terms community outreach I think becomes really critical

[03:04:00]
when we start talking about the Martinez Yazzie population that we're trying to reach that requires meeting them on their Turf and so any ideas about how we might get creative with that because I think that needs to happen as often as is the community engagement piece so and about the same time I think so yeah just some feedback we don't want to Eclipse that population are you guys looking at it from the distinction

[03:05:00]
Community engagement is usually done by like what we two or more we host it and on so like these other things so in terms of like going out to to Canvas OR virtually events are you thinking of that also with more than one board member working as a team on that like similar to what we did okay yeah so like engagement is very much we bring we bring people to us Outreach is we go out to them but to do that with another board member always always going to hear different things from any discussions so that is that is and in fact on our planning document we've included the definition of Engagement in the definition of Outreach at the top so that we always remember what that distinction is okay

[03:06:00]
so yeah so some cool ideas there is one cool idea that I don't think is a boredness board idea so I'm going to throw it out to the district just cuz I'm sure you guys need one more thing to do but I thought that Rio Rancho public schools are doing a parent you it's called parent University and every month they're discussing a different topic that is specifically for parents and I just thought that was so cool as a way to engage parents like the first one was on attendance the importance of attendance and the second one is going to be on the evolved Safety Systems so I mean it could be a potentially could be a board thing where we were but it was more very specific about yeah it's an operation thing so I just thought that was really cool to Justin Bieber will be happy to come over and tell you about the parent University we've been running for the last couple years

[03:07:00]
you bring people together for a targeted conversation on it on an issue where

[03:08:00]
the board wants to meet you so that we can do that I mean I think I think that would be a great idea was to get those I have I have a question I'm trying to figure out the difference between the breakfast and the the evening event who's invited to the breakfast and how are they selected who are these out of town folks that are coming so the the the the the dinner so on the 29th that's Tuesday night and the invitees to that were were primarily the attendees for the community listening session from last the community sessions from last time from the last fall so that's kind of a smaller group is who was invited to that the the breakfast is

[03:09:00]
targeted to like elected officials so that's who is invited to that and it's just about a 45-minute session and then the Summit is is opened up to gosh I mean don't worry community community but the breakfast also includes organizations that donors that the funders funders and legislators of the timeline of events happened

[03:10:00]
pull the dates and they also sent the calendar invites out so what may we share and invite to a larger what may we share and send out invitations to a larger group of people and what are we as board members Limited in doing in that process so I think it's a yes that's a good question the Summit is good for Community leaders and organizations but but individuals probably the wouldn't you say the dinner like individuals if you have somebody that you'd like to invite just send it to Christy so that you more work send it to Christie just so she can double check that they haven't already been invited because this is a pretty extensive list

[03:11:00]
so just double check I mean can't we post that list on it's on the invite list is on Google on a Google doc right yeah we could probably just share it and share it that would be good just like we did before when we were doing the listening sessions so we could serve see if there were people we knew of the word yeah exactly she's busy trying to figure out what schools are available for the community engagement anything else

[03:12:00]
anything else are you good no no we're done yet cancel any other questions good right our next Board of Education meeting will be held August 16th when it's tonight isn't it I know what says the next Board of Education will be held August 16th wait that's tonight I know it's like it's on my notes so it's the next special Board of Education you know August 23rd 2023 at 5:30 p.m. or immediately following the finance committee that's what it's missing on here is when's the next finance committee meeting on the 23rd there you go meetings will be held at the Alison Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard North East and live stream on aps.com edu and with that we are adjourned thank you I just read what's in front of me
