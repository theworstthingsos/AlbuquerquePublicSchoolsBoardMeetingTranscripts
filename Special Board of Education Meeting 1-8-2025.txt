[00:04:00]
learning experience it has given me the opportunity to advocate for students and Community while working toward meaningful progress in our schools last night is I reflected on my decision to run for vice president of our school board I was confronted with a sobering reality after a full day dedicated to training and board responsibilities I returned home feeling the way of the day exhausted I sat down and turned on the television would stop me in my tracks were images of burning houses and orange reports urging evacuation it was the Pacific

[00:05:00]
Ohio State's Fire at that moment I thought struck me with a full voice my daughter has been living through this all day I hadn't called her to check in if she was safe if she needed my support or even simply to say I'm here for you it was a life-or-death situation yet I allowed the demands of the board work to distract me from what from what truly matters the well-being of my family and by extension the students and families we serve in this District this realization was a turning point for me it reminded me of the importance of balance perspective and priorities prioritizing what truly makes a difference in our lives and the lives of those we serve it is it is it is this Clarity that feels my decision to step into leadership not for the sake of busy work but to ensure that our board remains focused on what matters most the success and well-being of students family and the community however this journey has not been

[00:06:00]
one of the most difficult obstacles my face is the president of lateral violence disrespectful and undermining behaviors from fellow board members the threats to derail the collaborative Spirit necessary for Effective governance lateral violence whether through bullying unconstructive criticism exclusion blaming gossiping social isolation or other harmful actions is an unfortunate reality in many professional settings including Public Service Facebook has tested my resolve but it also strengthened my commitment to fostering an environment of respect transparency and mutual understanding I've come to realize that lateral violence not only affects individuals but also hinders are collective ability to serve students and families dependent on us through this experience I have learned the importance of standing firm in my values and practicing

[00:07:00]
I'm focusing on a bigger picture rather than allowing negative behaviors to dictate our actions I have chosen to respond with professionalism persistent and a focus on Building Bridges whenever possible this journey has brought attention to the Mean Girls syndrome mean girl behavior is often a rational aggression or alternative aggression and indirect harmful form of social bullying those who engage in this relationship aggression want to make a person look bad to others bring them down or take away what the other person has most people don't realize they're being mean even though they are I invite you to watch recorded meetings for March May or even September's policy meaning this journey has also reinforced my belief that open communication accountability and a shared sense of purpose are critical to overcoming challenges like these

[00:08:00]
this is not a focus of this leadership being the first Native American on this board was a great Triumph but it has also filled with negativity I have deep concerns our behaviors on this board directly affect our superintendent or staff cabinet administrators teachers and students I observe a Hearts patriarchal patriarchal mentality and the leadership style to hide it not address it paint the perfect picture is not okay the trumpet of myself has its repercussions to also affect other Native American staff students and Community to my fellow board members I extend an invitation to engage in dialogue that Fosters understanding and unity our roles are not about personal agendas or individual victories but about working together for the greater good of our schools and Community to our students staff and families and remain steadfast and my commitment to serving with Integrity resilience and

[00:09:00]
focus on the future this experience has strength to my resolve to continue advocating for a school board culture that values respect collaboration and the well-being of everyone involved I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as vice president and to have learned the lessons I did along the way I will continue to approach my to my board responsibilities with the dignity and determination that our students deserve will the day come where people of color will no longer have to endure the oppression of their oppressors I don't know but I do know I don't have to endure the meanness because of my meant because of my mental health physical health and spiritual health that matters to me it is time we take a strong look at ourselves because the children and teachers of this District are going through the same treatments I withdraw my submission for vice president and I will stand in an example of someone who refuses to accept and to

[00:10:00]
turn to the punitive treatment thank you Reynolda Town burrito that's it thank you are there any further nominations for the office of Vice President all right so the nominations that we have for the office of Vice President Jackson yes we will now move on to the office of secretary nominations are now in order acknowledging again that member of submitted a statement in advance I will nominate to serve as secretary are there any other further nominations for the office

[00:19:00]
5:00 p.m. 5:15 p.m. thank you 5:15 all right our next item is to discuss bored time use evaluation in our presenter for this one is member Topia Romero here we go guys do you have the floor okay so first I want to start off just by thinking Secretary of score for helping me navigate through all of this and categorize everything properly so I just want to publicly acknowledge your time and support and making sure this was allocated you know what the best that it could be so looking through it to give a quick summary especially if we go through like a year in all of 2024 for each quarter I wanted to just do a quick recap so for the first quarter of 2024 we had a percentage of 31% that we allocated with our time focused on sfg

[00:20:00]
if we continue to Quarter Two we improved going from 31st to 39.45% finally wrapping up quarter for the challenges continue to embrace all of us and we ended with a percentage of only 7% looking at these October was the only month for we actually received some time Associated that could count towards sosg we had other things that we committed time to where we had like the massive report that we actually had to discuss but knowing that it wasn't actually specific time that we were able to count towards our minute usage we weren't able to use the time associated with that there was a lot of time that we dedicated in our month of meeting with December being the highest of 757 minutes

[00:21:00]
due to having a board retreat but none of it was it was able to be counted when we look at our overall I guess challenges that we've had keep in mind that you know we've asked going forward to be able to say that the ad hoc meetings to be able to use those in the future however remembering that we can't use our community engagement time that we have there and I think it's important to like when and this is just a side note as I was really diving into this today because we've adapted this tool to really help us stay accountable to each other and making sure that we are following guidelines but it's concerning to see that we've actually had a decrease that instead of actually using improve and make significant improvements of you know our time use being used appropriately we've gone the opposite

[00:22:00]
Direction and I'm going to throw it out there too and and president Gonzalez if this isn't if I shouldn't say this you could just tell me crystal don't say that and I'll respect you but I would propose like a rhetorical question to everyone what would be the best way for us to hold each other accountable nothing we have to answer now but as we look forward to really use the tools that we're giving us and for us to be able to practice best use of our time because I don't want to feel coming here knowing that we spent goodness one for this last quarter it's 17 over close to 1800 minutes and only $120 of those minutes counted again there was other minutes that of course this is work that needs to be done and we have to have these discussions but how can we hold each other accountable better because all of us have different styles we have different ways that we

[00:23:00]
we want to be held to a standard but personally I am someone who does look at the the figures and when I see that we're actually going the opposite direction I want us to be very intentional on what actions we could all hold ourselves to or holding what actions we told ourselves accountable to sing significant Improvement personally 2025 can only get better I don't see how we can go lower than 7% but I do feel like it's important that all seven of us keep each other accountable and in line you know so again I throw that question out to everybody because I think it's important that we all respect each other in terms of how we are held accountable but it's something that isn't forgotten about and I don't want to just to get lost in the work but without showing what we're committed to one thing

[00:24:00]
call make note of is I feel like even now during public comment they've started to hold us accountable to what the goals and guardrails are saying and seeing our constituents come back at us we in turn have to do the same with each other so I'm just putting that out there for all of us I think it's important that we do improve on our numbers go in forward aside from that I do want to ask and I don't know if this Fall's on Dr Albright or if it's with with cell when we're good looking on the YouTube videos we don't see the time stamps there for each each section so it makes it challenging to be able to to know how much time we spent on certain topics I know we had them at one point but the different chapters but it wasn't we can look into that okay that would be fantastic because this is a job

[00:25:00]
and then I think at a minimum if not time-stamping the YouTube that we can load it in the minutes awesome and then keep in mind too obviously we we know that the guard rails don't count for we don't get credit for those minutes so that's why we move that to consent agenda but personally I feel like we have we have a lot of improvements to make but we could only go up from here so having said that I will open it up for any questions and then I'll turn it over to Secretary of for some additional input that she has related to our instrument here so thank you remember your room into your question around accountability I think for the purpose of the agenda what is posted we need to discuss only time you said evaluation if we want to talk about our Behavior managing our behaviors holding each other accountable governing ourselves we can hold that to January 15th and we do the south of evaluation and all so when we

[00:26:00]
evaluation and I will make sure that everybody gets this document as well so you can see what that looks like I did just want to know if we look at our monitoring calendar there are months where we do not do any gold monitoring so we will see a decline in those months or those quarters so that was that's just what happened with November and December we had no scheduled goal monitoring so even though it feels really heavy we kind of anticipated that this might happen because we didn't have that schedule so like remember top your Romero has said in 2025 we have a great start to the year so we'll be monitoring go for in January go 1 and 2 in February and March

[00:27:00]
we will see another decline in April because we don't have a monitoring session that month so just a reminder to look at the monitoring calendar so we can kind of see where we should continue to monitor go so we can get those points or if there's something important that we should do another suggestion that I do have in for June because we don't have a monitoring for June or July is that we do end of year results and I know that superintendent has has already started talking about that but we can talk about those end of your results because it is student outcomes Focus for our results that students will have in the fall so that can potentially add some points in the summer when it comes to sfg discussions so just a suggestion there but also like just end on like a light note we anticipated this because there was no goal monitoring so it does look scary but we'll we'll pick it up in the next few months thank you any other comments

[00:28:00]
questions you have one number don't worry too whatever happened to our Outreach to 1000 students that we stated last year that was a goal we made it a goal but I don't know what happened with it so that's part that's not related to time use okay but I'm just I'm just asking the question so we can ask the chair of our committee on community engagement on where we stand with our goals so if you can email that to sorry we have a fantastic when is the appropriate time to raise a question about how we or what we consider as

[00:29:00]
or how we reconsider what we count as a student outcomes focused government governance topics where does that conversation happen you want to respond to him that we are having a training on community to the right direction to adding those into time that counts for us so if she so that's something that's coming up that will have a training on I'm not sure about is there a month a time that you set aside and date for that I don't actually use watching so maybe she'll text us if she has that answer I don't believe a time has said it's in the calendar for us so if she implementation which only goes through the end of February so it would have to be

[00:30:00]
so that would probably be something that you can send directly to Ashley and AJ okay and and I'm just going to note that she did during the December 20th 2024 Workshop acknowledge that sfg is a framework that we the aps board must Implement on our terms right to reflect our values what we we find important so I'm just reiterating that sentiment is it possibility for

[00:31:00]
will be the next person to be trained so that would be a good opportunity for the three of you to connect on that and then maybe you could report back anything does that work and so since remember top your own just presented for this quarter number Dominguez will present for the next quarter of the time use okay I think what's helpful to remember Dominguez when we look at the worksheet and it'll it'll explain things at a greater understanding once you dive into because the framework really goes into great detail that discuss the Visions goals values monitoring accountability communication and collaboration continuous Improvement so there is a tool in a scale that we are following based on something

[00:32:00]
I believe we voted on this golly a year ago it might have been but I could be wrong I don't want to speak out of line but I think once you dive into it personally cuz that's what helped me it'll actually become a lot more understandable you know on how we're scoring it and what we're giving credit to and what we're not because it's hard it's hard to see so many zero percents when we feel like we are doing the work and we're not getting the credit but I do I'll just leave it at that anyways any other comments on YouTube all right so keep in mind we again decoupled the time used from the south of evaluation so that you have this information when you do yourself evaluation so we will be considering the self-evaluation with the January 15th on the January 15th

[00:33:00]
the meeting deadlines since you sent just directly to me and I review it it doesn't have to go through the whole staff process so you will submit your own self evaluation that'll be Consolidated and then presented back out but now you have the data on how much time we used in the last quarter all right so we will then move on to agenda item five and to kick off the new year we thought it would be good idea to give board members a chance to share their thoughts about the New Year about open communication reflection and staying focused on our commitment to student outcomes and keeping our discussions aligned with our goals so we will start it either would you like to begin give me a little more time I'll pass it on for now okay sorry I didn't have a speech prepared

[00:34:00]
I'm excited to start this New Year and I'm excited we have our officers and everybody in place and I feel like we're in a good place ready to move forward and stick to our mission which is student outcomes focusing on the students that is why I'm here and it's very clear to me and it's easy to do the work because of that and I'm just really grateful to work alongside each of you and I hope it's a good healthy year for everyone and let's just say It's My Hope thanks thank you thank you I guess first congratulations to our new cabinet and the people who are going to be joining you know and setting the tone for the new year I look forward to seeing what you all are going to work with the superintendent I'm going to point more my comments towards our superintendent because I'm truly excited this being a whole brand new year for you and what your

[00:35:00]
what you're going to do with the district makes me extremely hopeful like probably the most I've ever felt in sitting on the board now and and I want to remind all of us and I think I've said it before it's okay for us to disagree like that's the reason there are seven of us because we have different insights and opinions backgrounds we represent different people and and I don't see it as a bad thing when we don't always see eye-to-eye you know the goal is always to be respectful with one another but it's I want everyone to feel like they can still say what they need to say and speak their mind but this year's going to be an exciting year for all of us you know this is going to be very telling because we've done the work all the prep work for sosg and to see what's going to continue after February and really put our actions to what we said we were going to do and I would just challenged us to to hold each other to a high standard hold us all accountable

[00:36:00]
I'm I'm hoping we all stay positive because it can be hard no one talks about the Dark Side of serving on a school board but there is one and overall you know it's still makes me excited to show up to our meetings that we have and I always say we should sell tickets but here we go thank you I'll go to member Storey going to be able to do that so that's exciting and put that to work so I'm very hopeful and yeah I see a lot of a lot of good things happening

[00:37:00]
I feel like they both said it beautifully so nothing else thank you remember Jackson thank you so I usually every year I post on my Facebook page just kind of a review of what we've done and so I just thought that I would maybe read that because I think it's always good to see you like to look back on how hard we've actually worked and what we've accomplished so if you'll allow me I'll just read this and so three years ago today I was born I was born into serve on the aps Board of Education below is my reflection on a year of growth and gratitude it's an honor and a privilege to continue to serve for our students we welcome to New leadership we welcome to New superintendent who wholeheartedly Embraces APS schools and guardrails her persistence and determination are already driving us toward meaningful achievements I had the honor of presenting at the Council of great City Schools National Conference to showcase our successful

[00:38:00]
strategies for superintendent hiring and Community engagement and we partnered with New Mexico United to host the first annual community engagement event focused on goal number one literacy reassured that art and music programs are going to be available in every elementary school every year we held the first ever I just saw a picture of my husband I'm sorry we conducted an intensive superintendent search incorporating input from students and families through multiple Community engagement events and we welcome and began collaborating with three new board members fostering teamwork and a shared Vision on a personal note this year abroad incredible loss and sorrow but amidst the heartache

[00:39:00]
we were uplifted by the overwhelming love and compassion from family friends and the APS in Albuquerque communities and I want to thank each and everyone of you for showing my girls that even in the hardest times kindness and compassion Prevail so looking forward I just want to thank you for being part of this journey and I'm really am excited I really am I'm excited to continue working together for our students or schools in our community in the year thank you remember Jackson Remember Domingos I think it's going to keep saying this we're going to make it a great year and I mean that there have been challenges and I'm not going to skirt the elephant in the room

[00:40:00]
I want to recognize everything that you said I don't want to sweep it under the rug I know it's been hard but you can bet on having a sanctuary on the policy committee and so I'm looking forward to sharing my strengths as policy chair and those strengths are based on my commitment to a collaborative supportive and culturally in psychological safe implementation of student outcomes Focus governance I want to reiterate what are coach recently acknowledged or the sentiments that she acknowledged at the 20 December 2024 workshop and that is that this is a framework and that we have an opportunity

[00:41:00]
to do it our way because we are known nationally as being at the four of doing things differently we are in Indian country and that means something that means a ton it means adopting a philosophy and my philosophy of leadership aligns with values such as transparency inclusiveness over exclusivity collaboration and above all supportive and I'm going to supportive accountability using email address of fearless leadership and for those of you who don't remember who Amy and Edmondson

[00:42:00]
Novartis professor of leadership and management at the Harvard Business School she is a an author of The Fearless organization creating psychological safety in the workplace for learning Innovation and growth and I take to heart This Woman's book in her Concepts because it's you know s o f g I may take issue with the Council on many things but they do provide us with these outstanding resources and so I'm I'm eager to implement that notion of what she calls situational humility which means that you can make mistakes on this device

[00:43:00]
and we approached those mistakes not with punitive or disciplinary responses but rather with curiosity like why is this happening why are what is leading to mistakes and and then having a conversation about it so I would look forward to doing that through the policy committee and you know we've done incredible work the strengths of sfg include the the government's manual that clearly delineates and four sections the policies that we dedicate ourselves to making and this I find historic making the targeted population of the Martinez and Yazzie decision the focus

[00:44:00]
monthly progress monitoring of Data Tracking their academic growth by way of our goals 1 and 2 but I love that our district thank you to cabinet and to our superintendent I love that our district doesn't have to be told to look at those targeted populations for goals 3 and 4 it just makes sense because the data tells us that it makes sense to focus on them I look forward to strengthening Community engagement and Outreach to include topics such as the right size and repurposing a policy on on Charter Schools that allows us to be better

[00:45:00]
formed on both topics before they get to us for a vote and yeah I'm eager to implement some of the readings and podcasts that are our coach suggested Stephen Covey I love that he says that punitive and harsh responses in organizations are old time thinking that's great to hear from someone of his caliber and and given his given his link to his father and I want to reiterate my commitment to sosg guiding principles until adult behaviors change and so that means

[00:46:00]
we must reflect what we want our children to experience in the classroom and that begins with me in collaboration with this board with the superintendent and her cabinet the administrative support staff and it filters down to School site employees how we treat each other matters the kids are watching and I'll land on this it saddens me to hear that the lateral violence that I had to experience throughout the year spread to board member Tony for speaking up against it and as a result we're going to lose her as vice president ironically yesterday we had two incredible workshops put on by American Indians for opportunity Lori Harris presented a workshop on

[00:47:00]
Navajo Nation superintendent Roy Tracy and I would hope that their teachings they're gentle perspective they're fierce perspective they're resilience will be applied not only in the classroom but also in the boardroom thank you thank you and before I made my decision to not resume my position my go to film and anytime when I am going through a struggle or to figure out what brings me back to the reality and the realness of why I do what I do and that's the movie March

[00:48:00]
penguins and this documentary is about resilience cooperation and the determination of the emperor penguin to survive and thrive in harsh conditions will the film centers on nature is themes are often valuable insights into improving education there are a few areas that I just want to highlight and what this film showed me when it pertains to education number one Community Support is essential number two endurance and patience you'll results number three protect and nurture the vulnerable it's one reason why I love this picture because I often feel that it's the adult

[00:49:00]
that have to protect the children and the endurance of the Penguins to protect their little one and the fathers who go without food for four to five months before the mother penguin gets there and the longevity that it takes for them to walk just to protect this little offspring that they brought into this world so and then number four adapting to changing conditions number five leadership and Collective responsibility number 6 the importance of shared sacrifices and number seven to celebrate the milestones we are going to have to endure this coming year and I have in my biggest piece of this and what's reflected is what's going on with

[00:50:00]
fires in Los Angeles those fires are over and I don't know what we're going to do when we do face those issues because the one thing I've realized in this District where is the Hope where is the Hope for our children or is the Hope for teachers where is the Hope for our staff because the one thing that guides hope is love this is an example of love I'm not going away because my subjects are still special education still Community involvements Charter Schools and what's really going on with our middle schools that's my priorities this year and I'm going to make sure that I do what I need to do to fulfill those needs so I do think you all for everything

[00:51:00]
we're doing but I also know that I have a responsibility and I'm not done so thank you thank you remember to I'm worried too and as I thought about tonight and about the year ahead I thought I would be relevant to discuss the values of integrity and character and elected office in part because I was reflecting on the legacy of Jimmy Carter as tomorrow is a national day of mourning for the former president and reflecting on his legacy I found a quote that he said we must adjust to Changing Times and still hold to unchanging principals and that felt very relevant for the work that we are doing and I think in the way that our guard rails represent the value of our community and hold us to what we need to do that's what important and is unchanging so that really resonated deeply as we think about navigating the complexity of Ward service but also navigating our roles

[00:52:00]
Integrity is a steadfast anchor and that's what leads us with purpose and with authenticity and I think just another quote from President Carter he reminded us that a leader takes people where they want to go a great leader takes people where they don't necessarily want to go but ought to be and that resonated is also resonated for me also and serves as a guiding principle I think in our commitment to this work as well to no matter what ensuring that our students not only Thrive academically but also grow into responsible good caring loving and compassionate and good people good citizens thinking about this time that we're in not just what's happening tomorrow but in the week of the week ahead we know that we live in a world filled with uncertainty and in these times of uncertainly Hope becomes even more important

[00:53:00]
and of course there's another Jimmy Carter quote about hope so he says we can choose to alleviate the suffering of our people and he in in times of challenge emphasizing that the power of collective action and thinking about Collective action in the context of the school board and of our endeavors knowing that we have the power to use our Collective action to choose hope and to choose optimism and to choose collaboration to choose integrity and I hope that we can do that so we can work together to Foster environment where everyone in the school system feels valued tonight I also just wanted to acknowledge that I think all the dogs that I think are children are still not all rights we know we have a lot of work to do to improve academic outcomes there's a lot we need to do as a school system is in a community to improve overall child's well-being part of that is related to school climate and sense of belonging but there's a lot more related to just

[00:54:00]
