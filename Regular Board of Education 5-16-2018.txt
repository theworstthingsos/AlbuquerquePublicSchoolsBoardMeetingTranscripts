Africa comets within the public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you and you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you are always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you are unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak within the 30-minute public forum the Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting is so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn only at this time at this time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member but I'm going to do is I'm going to call up the first three speakers and if you could line up then we'll we'll just keep calling up like that the first one is David Hanson second is Dana Ziegler

[00:37:00]
hello my name is David Hanson this is my wife Stephanie over the last 4 years we've been very active parents in our neighborhood School Painted Sky Elementary we have supported our son's teachers and attended nearly every school event my wife even went there to work there two years ago as an EA in the bilingual education program but on February 20th every thing changed our 8 year old son was brutally attacked by a classmate on the playground during recess without any warning no prior energy interaction or verbal exchange this classmate ran up behind her son grabbed him by the back of the head and slammed his face into the playground equipment he landed with his head inside of a climbing ladder period Administration the next day they insisted that it was a playground

[00:38:00]
the response was to discipline the perpetrator by making him write a book report and present it to his peers because public shaming is how they choose to deal with bullies needless to say I was Furious I filed a report with APS police who did a thorough investigation and concluded this was a battery but they told us they wouldn't do anything because of the age of the offending child they said they would simply defer to the Painted Sky Administration he was suspended for a day and a half following that investigation we met with the school administration in the following Monday

[00:39:00]
what's my son occurred a power differential was created one in which my son had the least amount my son stated that he has witnessed this student bullying others before there was no clear history of bullying my son yet from that day forward a clear and deliberate pattern of bullying has emerged while he is not physically injured my son again he has consistently sought to intimidate my son and to isolate him from his friends and peers on the playground we have repeatedly reported this to the school administration who have dismissed our concerns their attitude that our son has not been physically hurt again so they are doing their job we escalated our grievance to student services in zone two principal support in an effort to resolve this solution nothing has worked I called the superintendent's office four days thank you so much regardless we have been painted sky no longer

[00:40:00]
safe with my wife working there The Painted Sky Administration has turned into a bully themselves they have continually violated confidentiality and we have to stick with that so everybody can do it okay if you need to talk with him one of the administrators please do that afterwards okay please do that we only have two minutes we only have 2 minutes okay that's all we have thank you thank you I understand if you could please please leave you with this for Christmas

[00:41:00]
has reached by Administration staff at City Center is confusing and appears to not be in the best interest of our children are primary concerns are extremely late notice of this decision and a lack of detailed information provided to us the movement of students within the district are limited understanding is that a many of the students at Madison will be moved to Hayes and then all of our students that are not in zone one will be moved to Madison even though they live within the boundary of Hoover Middle School frequent turnover of staff at Hayes which will result in a lack of consistency when our children leave the STS classrooms are students need frequent interactions with neurotypical peers to build their pragmatic language and social interaction skills decision that seems to be very last minute poorly thought-out and continue to evidence of a lack of consideration by the special education department at City Center we were told this decision was based on numbers alone this makes very little sense and the kind of

[00:42:00]
it has to take into consideration the needs of our children with autism and their families you are splitting up a fantastic special ed team because of this decision is the district had bothered to do anything other than look at the numbers they might have realized the teams such as ours are rare within the district our students frequently comment that coming to coming to Hoover was the first time they actually enjoyed school we and our students deserve better from this that from the special education department we are heartbroken that are close knit well-functioning team will be torn apart we are heartbroken about what this decision will do to our students and we are furious with Administration that this decision was made so close to the end of the year and I would like to submit a written statement if that's okay with the board thank you I work at Hoover Middle School

[00:43:00]
I have taught in the autism program for 8 years I get kicked hit scratched spit on and I still love my program my students are kind caring funny intelligent and a joy to be with and again I am here with my team we work together well and now we are being our world was turned upside down Monday afternoon at 2:45 my program is being moved to Hayes at the meeting little information was given they were unable to tell us when the parents will be notified there are what 6 days of school left they were unable to tell us where our kids will be going Madison or Hayes they told us we have until Friday to make a decision to move or find another position are students are being sent to an F School

[00:44:00]
more than 2 years and they do not have the facilities we need for our kids in the SCS programs I was told by Lila Ramirez that Transportation should have a student list to her by Friday what is going on it is quite apparent that transportation is making placement decisions for our special needs students what is going on we are frustrated by the lack of support understanding and consideration that the special education department is demonstrating to our students and to our staff superintendent Reedy what is going on you just continue the autism resource team what is going on your decisions are not made with the students in mind that is a parent time and time again how do you intend to keep special education teachers when we are treated this way

[00:45:00]
they worked hard for my degree I work hard for my students and I get very little respect from the aps special education department thank you what is going on we are frustrated and heartbroken thank you thank you period my name is Logan I'm a student from Leadership Academy I'm going to tell you about the

[00:46:00]
play things I like about my school first thing the teachers I like that they are I like that they are patient considering and Vigilant second thing I like that I like what we learned it is exciting it is important and it is funny thing I like the everybody everybody in the school everybody treats each other like family and I would not be who I am today without Ana thank you for listening

[00:47:00]
that's a tough act to follow Prejudice it's hard to explain perceptions between white people and black people still very hard to explain the Civil Rights Act started on December 1st 1955 in Birmingham Alabama we've learned nothing from it the the Obama era I was talking to a co-worker of mine 33 or so today and he said you know what Franklin I do it subconsciously he's white and male and I said I know I felt

[00:48:00]
I feel it everyday when I walk into a school building it's everywhere it's what the millennial generation is struggling with period period

[00:49:00]
and how important it is to continue the program so that in future the families can benefit and kids can benefit from this program so one of the important things about the program was the way that it was conducted so Sandy was a very great resource and she was a great teacher the way she conducted the program she made it a fun learning thing and then we are very important other aspect of the program was the video presentations that were Incorporated in between the whole learning process and she also made the home and record when we are interacting with our kids and then based on those video clips they will show us how we can improve and do it better do a better job that help us learn a lot and teaching and we got a great learning from the program and based on all the things that we learned lot of things with my son and I'm happy and proud to say that with all that we learned

[00:50:00]
arson has made significant improvements and then he would be going to a regular kindergarten school with just few Services which have been specified and he would get all those at a regular kindergarten so I would just like to Applause and for Sandy can you please thank you so this has been a great program Naruto Lopez John cannabis good evening president and Board of Education members my name is Lopez and I'm the president of Santa Barbara martineztown neighborhood association I'm a 1978 graduate of Albuquerque High and a proud bulldog

I am here to recognize and celebrate also Mr Herbert Stanley Mr Stanley exemplifies a strong leader of which is why we would like to see him as our next principal at Albuquerque High School Mr Stanley has had a strong relationship in the community and has attended many of our meetings he worked with us and our representative at that time Rick meta at the to deal with the flooding that was the current from Albuquerque High School and we received funding to place a ponding at the Albuquerque High School property he also works with us on the neighborhood safety and preservation work that we're doing Mr Stanley has a strong relationship with our community because he has taken the time to build that relationship and has made an effort to meet with us all the time and so that's the reason

[00:52:00]
Play We would like to see him as our principal because he our community deserves a leader who is part of the community he has made that effort with us so I thank you for this opportunity to talk about him and we we hope that you will consider him as our next principal at Albuquerque High thank you my story about the program which helps helps parents with kids who have autism communicate better behaved one of them is on the autistic Spectrum one of them

[00:53:00]
add zero friends to and a half years ago and barely communicated at all we got into the Hannon program because one kindergarten teacher knew about the program I'm really shocked at how many Educators don't know about the program and frankly appalled that they don't know about the program but we found in the two and a half years that generally their behavior has gotten much better their 6 years old as long as they're not hungry I can I can call him down and keep them behaving the program has honestly just been the greatest thing

[00:54:00]
I would like to stay and and listen to Sandy talk about her program but it's obviously not going to happen thank you very much thank you ok Google in 2014 with 32 years ago from teacher 26 of these years High School the school that I graduated from in 1977 from 1988 to 2014 the school which began in 1879 means the world to me

[00:55:00]

[00:56:00]

[00:57:00]
no more speakers that we still have to get our time in Zeta raimondi and Anna McKee hi my name is for students on the autism spectrum I am a teacher at Madison Middle School and I found out this afternoon that several students from our school are going to be transferred to Hayes Middle School to have students at one school 167th grade and then transfer them to 8 would be difficult for a typically developing student for students on the autism

[00:58:00]
Spectrum it's even harder it's greatly magnified for them some it's taken some of these students over a year to acclimate to being at one school and here they're going to be transferred to another school that is not promoting their success at all okay I am a firm believer that being on the autism spectrum is a challenge it doesn't have to Define them but this type of transfer will actually Define them and in a negative way I asked that you rethink this decision in good conscience and may I suggest that if you're going to begin this process you do that with students who are going to transition from elementary to middle school anyway thank you

[00:59:00]
excuse me I have a cold good evening my name is Anna McKee and I wanted to thank you all this evening to have the opportunity and the honour to speak because of the Hannon program my husband and I participated in the program for the past 3 years it's a phenomenal program and you've heard the other parents talk about it it's got at least three decades of research behind it I think it's absolutely amazing we have gone from more than words to talkability with our child and it's greatly helped us not just at home but also externally more out in the community and its increased his ability to speak by a great amount I would also ask you for two things to think about they are The Little Engine That can and they are doing amazing work in APS I cannot express my gratitude for these two women because they have changed our lives and the lives of our son and so I just wanted to say thank you and also to ask of you two things for them

[01:00:00]
when is that the doors are open in the classrooms by the teachers to welcome them into the classroom so they can bring what they have learned about the children into the classroom as well to help with the speech in the classroom and help with playing with other children and making friendships and then continue to have the program open and to have communication about it it's quite shocking to see that the program has been around so long and there is so little activity that has occurred but there's only two women so they need more supports and I think they all need help in training the teachers more and in training the speech language pathologist this program is tremendous I can't tell you how good it is you have to live it to believe it and I think we really need a lot more partnership with the teachers and with the slopes to kind of marriage that partnership from the home into the classroom and that can't be done without your continued support of the program and continued support for those members that are touching our children

[01:01:00]
turn off lights in the school so thank you very much this evening thank you you're welcome and recognition recognition of the importance of bilingualism and by literacy public schools has developed a clear pathway K through 12 in which students have the opportunity to acquire a district seal K through 12 and a state of New Mexico

[01:02:00]
and by literacy seal in Spanish Native American languages in foreign languages the Spanish bilingual seal and the Seal of Distinction honors a student's proficiency and skills in two languages as a district we encourage students to pursue rigorous coursework that provides an opportunity for students to maintain develop an advance in English and Spanish and other languages the completion of the specified units of credit and the portfolio will serve as evidence of their skills for future college career and personal opportunities as well as provide an opportunity for each school to evaluate a student holistically it is a very difficult and involved process and student portfolio presentations are really very very impressive the bilingual Seal program saw address drastic increase in their number of participants and seals in

[01:03:00]
the school year 1718 there are 418 High School bilingual seals that were given and there are 167 Elementary and Middle School bilingual seals this is a new program this year and we are very very proud of it so that brings the total for 2017-18 total number of bilingual seals K through 12 of 500 and 585 this is an increase of 360 from the previous school year and a total increase of 231 participants from the previous school year I'm thankful you have no idea how thankful I am for all the teachers and staff who helped make this important program possible in a recent presentation to the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce

[01:04:00]

for you instead of bringing them as two separate agenda items weeks apart and not make that deliberate connection so Patricia and I stand for questions regarding the notice of unsatisfactory performance and I do have Justina Montoya from the principal and founder of the school and Robert lemming the the governing body president who was also here to who may offer a response the school did respond to the notice of unsatisfactory performance and Mrs Yeager did provide that to you through electronically I believe yesterday yesterday was the 10-day the end of the 10th for them to respond OK Google

[01:15:00]
2 minutes cuz this is like a public forum but yet you're presenting here as part of this item so just want to make sure you understand we got 2 minutes okay thank you guys Mr President members of the board superintendent reading my name is Rob Fleming and I'm the president of the law wrestle on a Leadership Academy governing Council I'm also a parent of a special education student there my son Logan actually spoke earlier he's on the autism spectrum so we are very proud that he had the courage to this evening to speak I joined the governing Council a little more than a year ago when it came to my attention that the school needed some changes and it was with a mindset towards change and service that I joined the governing Council in the first place and during that time one of your former colleague Scott Duran was the president of our governing Council and under his leadership I found his leadership to be instructive and invaluable most importantly in the area of accountability and

[01:16:00]
I wanted to address that this evening Having learned some important lessons it is true that there were unsatisfactory results found in the special education audit however those results don't constitute the sum total of what our school is what our school culture is like or what are students experiences like since the findings of the audit principal Montoya Joe Dan Lovato or most senior special education endorsed teacher to level three endorsed special education consultants and myself have set into motion the corrective action plan which I believe you'll have a copy of and included in that plan as a system of transparency and accountability where the principal special education teachers and a team of other teachers in the school will review each and every IEP according to a strict schedule those systems didn't exist before and they do now and perhaps they should have been in place sooner admittedly and we are moving forward with that in addition to the corrective action plan in place

[01:17:00]
we intend to hire two special education teachers with at least level 2 qualifications so with this system in place with the experience that these individuals will bring to the table we hope that we won't have these problems in the future the expertise of those new hires is going to be invaluable lastly we have been in touch with a consulting firm to do a deep dive evaluation for strategic planning both short-term and long-term so that we can better as a governing Council as an Administration and staff and faculty address the needs of our students we've rapidly responded to these results and to improve our special education program and we are working tirelessly and we are confident that we will give the most experience to our students thank you very much thank you

[01:18:00]
I'm a teacher and Mentor at Laura Salon a Leadership Academy I currently possess a level 3 license in K-8 as well as special education with endorsements in science and health I was also a finalist for the 2018 teachers of the year it has been a distinct pleasure working at Laura salon and Leadership Academy for the past 11 years of their 12 year existence I come here before you to request your support on a Leadership Academy is contract for a 2-year renewal period because our model for Middle Education Works this can be proven by observing the results from the spring 2018 NWA Maps Shortcake assessment data according to this data the students who attended Laura Leadership Academy achieve the following games 72 percent of the cohort for the reading 2.6 grade levels in one year 75% of the cohort in math achieved 1.54 grade levels in one year and 81%

[01:19:00]
that cohort in science achieved 2.43 grade levels in one year respectively this data also includes the large population of students being served with an IEP we have been and are currently being recognized in a positive light by the state we finally we fully understand the severity of the audit findings within our department and are working diligently to correct these findings and complete all components of the corrective action plan in the coming weeks even though we did have issues with a special education department this is by no means a general reflection of the work we do with our students and the success we have worked so hard to achieve again your support for this renewal is critical and helping to provide a good free appropriate education to all students who enter our doors thank you for your time and your consideration thank you very much and we're open for comments

[01:20:00]
okay so if you have questions for Joseph or whatever we will be willing to entertain that yes board member Garcia thank you Mr scooter I'm just trying to figure out where we're at so you've documented that you had some concerns the school has responded and said they are addressing those concerns can we move forwards and if so Candice deciding what we're going to do or do we have to do that now in June Mister president must be executed by June 30th for the school or the school automatically doesn't have a contract and we must move

[01:21:00]
forward with closure procedures so if tonight you do not want to act on the contract that is fine we can bring it back at a later date where we are with the special education concern is the school has responded the next phase will be for they have drafted a corrective action plan that is not at this point acceptable to our office and we had a lengthy meaning about that yesterday and so we will be working with them on their draft but I want to make sure it's clear that we don't develop the corrective action plan it is important for the school itself to have that self-reflection and to be examining the systems and processes that have simply failed our special education students at the school so in in Patricia has a tremendous amount of

[01:22:00]
respect and I'm very lucky to have her on my team and in discussing with her and she can tell you herself but the she feels that with putting the proper systems and steps in place the school can move forward but it is important for us to put all of this into context for you with the history of the school in that last year they sought renewal with us at that time they had during our site visit for the renewal they disclosed that at 200,000 deficit pretty clothes we brought that to you we recommended denial we use the board agreed with the denial of the renewal they appealed to the public education department to ask us to work with the school and negotiate and during negotiations the deficit had

[01:23:00]
now we approve them for one year moving forward they brought the renewal application to us again during our review we didn't feel confident that they should receive a 5-year contract so we brought you a 2-year proposal and you approve that in the fall and so now we're we're moving forward with that contract but during that we have found this issue so we found like it needed to be brought to your attention transparently right and so the question is is this issue significant enough that we should deny this renewal Mister president I believe that if the school can move forward to fix the issues however with the history of the school I have major concerns about the viability and the long

[01:24:00]
turn goals and work of the school and the impact on our students this is our most vulnerable population that is not these students through our examination were not receiving the services that they needed to be okay so I'm assuming that you're answering and I think we need to just put it on the table with the school so we're clear as a board it's difficult to my opinion is one board member among the seven of us here it's difficult to decide what to do here giving what you've presented I have your concerns I have the response from the school I also remember the history that you Enlighten us with just now to remember something my

[01:25:00]
very unique services in our community where they seem to be meeting the needs of many students now again is this concern significant to the point that we need to say no this isn't really working or not I can't quite tell from your answer Mr President Mr Garcia we cannot give you a recommendation to revoke the charter because we have not followed what the contract prescribes which is issuing the notice of unsatisfactory performance the response the corrective action plan and letting that play out it may be very well that if we move forward with the contract that we come to you in the fall or spring and say they are either making great progress to correct the deficiencies or they may not I can't predict that but following the process I am not bringing you a recommendation of revocation at this time

[01:26:00]
okay thank you that's very helpful I just have a question can we execute a contract with the corrective action plan attached to it mister president

[01:27:00]
the unsatisfactory performance have on Charter renewal so I know they're not up for Renewal till 2 years from this past fall correct is that right 2019 is that right mister president a contract for July 1st 2018 through June 30th 2019 but they would have to submit their renewal in October 2000 19919 so a lot of the concerns of the same concerns that we saw last last fall when we were talking about renewal Mr President to Miss Miller

[01:28:00]
some of the things that have happened

[01:29:00]
so what kinds of things are are serious I mean I think they're all breaches but Mr Mr President and Miss Miller out of going any major deficiencies that are in line with our performance framework that we look at regarding academic operation and financial compliance so for example one of our Charter Schools is under correct or issue received a notice of unsatisfactory performance because of financial oversight concerns and repeated audit findings and so that is an example of another charter school that has moved forward with we have moved forward with the notice of unsatisfactory performance can you tell me if they're enrollment has increased because I know that's been a problem for a long time Mr President Miss Miller go and I believe their 120th day enrollment was

[01:30:00]
76 students is that correct can you come forward Miss Montoya I know it's been around 7:45

[01:31:00]
we had a very healthy conversation with Miss Montoya and Mr lemming yesterday and all in the spirit of moving forward and and what they needed to do to reflect on developing their corrective action plan and putting the systems and processes in place to support students and so our conversation yesterday with student focused and so I thought it was positive okay thank you yes provides Financial policies and procedures training and I may not have that correct in its name and once before I asked if our Charter Schools would be available to attend those kind of trainings and I noticed on here that you're requesting

[01:32:00]
the review an update of all their financial policies and procedures so again can they can Charter Schools attend the aps trainings that we provide so Mr President and Miss Armijo it varies by training but specifically now that we have a dedicated person for special education we will be providing those trainings and we have a great resource and Patricia and so she we are actually planning for next year to be having a monthly meetings that really coincide with what our special education department does with our head special ed teachers throughout the district anything else you want to know so that's that but that's great to know about special education policies and procedures as well so our financial Palace is a procedures we are Charter Schools Works directly with their business managers about

[01:33:00]
is there some sort of at least you know quarterly meeting that we could be doing to support them as well so we're also taking that view as well as Doctor remember Patterson Ave Maria

[01:34:00]
also in the last 5 years and we just came off a special ed corrective action plan a year ago and it fell apart again this year so we did correct we were successful and completing that special education corrective action plan with the public education department and and to work with an 8:00 p.m. IEP specialist for 2 years to get our program back where it needed to be and so we were confident at the beginning of this year that it was going to continue that way and it did not for special education

[01:35:00]
Mr President when a school switches authorizers from the public education commission we have requested the public education department to provide us with information of corrective action plans such as what was what was just reported to you by Miss Montoya the public education department did not provide us that during the LA Rosalina application so what we have done just to fix that system is any future renewals there is a section on the application that the school must disclose to us because of the concerns that that I have with my lack of communication that I get from the Charter School Division at the public education department

[01:36:00]
what is your budget what is your budget look like right now we have a 50,000 in emergency reserve and Reserve funds and our budget is healthy right now what does that mean that that we're ending the school year in the black and we were awarded some extra funds this year which gives us the funds that we need to hire the two special education teachers that were planning to hire so what was your budget like last year were you not able to hire well we traditionally we've hovered around 23% special ed for the last 11 years this year we had a really high in flux of special education students which we were unprepared for so we did apply for a waiver and those waivers were approved for the 4080 and 120

[01:37:00]
reporting and so with the extra funds that we got in this year in our in our interview with Patricia we did disclose that we were planning to hire two extra teachers next year so we do have the money to move ahead with that thank you period can you tell me just a little bit about the types of disabilities that you're having to accommodate so this year most of our students have are in the classroom with the regular education teacher teachers on an IEP and receiving services from the special education teacher that we had

[01:38:00]
and also from the regular regular education teachers with accommodations and modifications some of the disabilities we have range from we have a Down syndrome student we have some autistic students we have students who have various disabilities with processing being able to process language and writing skills and those kinds of things that were born with different disabilities would you say that at your school because of the lack of you know having the supports in you know in a real healthy way where these students not able to access like comprehensive like learning style or approaches

[01:39:00]
or adaptive equipment or things to help them to actually succeed in the classroom what are the things that that we've determined in reflecting on what's happened this year is that that in our conversations with parents students are teachers are ancillary staff we do feel that the the students did get the services that they were supposed to get as best as our special education teacher could provide those with the support of our other license special education teacher and the main problem was that the services were not documented correctly so on the IEP forms and other processes that that we did not have formalized in place is where the majority of our problems came from with this unsatisfactory performance

[01:40:00]
I didn't have an IEP this last year some of them came to us with out-of-date IEPs because for example a Down syndrome student that we have was homeschooled for a year so he came in with an outdated IEP because he'd been home-schooled for over a year and so you know we do get kids in that do come to us in circumstances like that with out-of-date IEPs get updated yes it did the coming months so can you just described and can you explain a little bit more why it fell apart the best way that I can

[01:41:00]
explain it is that we last year I hired a level one teacher who was participating in the opal program and so she was supposed to complete her licensure this year but she put it she's at the end of the school year putting in an extension for that so I think that with the influx that we got at the beginning of the school year of of students you know we had in our school I want to say we have about 17 6th graders and over half of them came in from APS cuz they were in traditional schools before with an IP so I think that she was overwhelmed with that and was not accepting of the support that we offered and then I also take resp

[01:42:00]
disability for not monitoring her more closely in terms of ensuring that the IEPs were compliant and documented correctly so here's my issue with all of this is I mean we know just from experience with an APS that staying on top of IEPs maintaining the special programs that are needed in a way it's hard work but when people start a charter it's saying we don't need your structure we don't need your rules we have a better way of doing it and does the school board the only thing the only Authority that we have really is to either say your not approved it's the responsibility of the charter to make it happen we have a responsibility for overseeing and making

[01:43:00]
sure that programs within APS are responsive that they follow and divided by the laws we have structures and supports in place for when that doesn't happen the nature of Charters is the charters are saying we want to break off we have the ability to do this and and we should be able to maintain independently so then when we come back we're faced with this dilemma of what do we do because in fact we have very little authority except to say thumbs up thumbs down the financial stuff it's the whole point with the charters is you are saying we don't want your help we want to break off we can do this and then we end up in situations where the pieces are trying to be picked up now without a doubt and it's one of the reasons why

[01:44:00]
all of the issues with Charters is difficult because there are some kids whose needs are met very well within the charters and so it's really emotional and but I find it to be a real dilemma that this is two two times in the last year that we that we are facing this with the hair salon it's a real concern and I know doctor the the efforts are being made to pull it together because there is a recognition that their kids that are benefiting from your program but I have a real hard time with it well thank you very much for the information

[01:45:00]
which is the frame the contract performance framework what you said in the first part is that in December we actually approved a two-year contract effective July 1st 2018 through July 30th 2019 that's only one year okay thank you that's my first clarification second thing is kind of interesting to me and I kind of don't find Charter Schools having very much to do a special education students and this is one which is kind of interesting to me in other words in general population of Education students is pretty low and it's usually not really talking about

[01:46:00]
other levels of special ed and and yet I think it is our requirement that if a charter can't provide those special education students service that we and APS are actually required to do that is that correct mister mister president members of the board we are not required to give the services to the students that is the requirement of the charter and so which is interesting because in reality in private schools we are required to do that that is correct so now I have a real I have a real name to go to Academy have to provide that service even though they may pay us for that I think there's a some kind of a funding

[01:47:00]
we're not required to provide that service if they cannot provide it that's what you're telling me is that right yes Mr President members of the board when the school writes the original charter they must describe what that special education process and program is and we must evaluate it to ensure that it is providing the services that are needed to the students and so that is Patricia's main responsibility and she has been in all 25 of our Charter Schools multiple times and I mean really appreciative of the special ed Department because because we need to bring all of our Charter Schools up to speed and special work in this area and and it's important to understand that what chart

[01:48:00]
is dude does affect us in terms of how we're rated findings we have various things because it's kind of reported as part of our our report to the public education department and so it's incumbent upon Charters to be able to provide those kinds of services which is difficult I'm talking about both Financial I'm talking about special education and those kinds of things which according to a little bit with what we really have no authority to do much other than to say well you know if you're not doing it and I know Don Duran's need to be able to provide the services and if you couldn't do it he wasn't in favor

[01:49:00]
have you been a charger I was kind of interesting because he was kind of a charger person to some extent you know he was kind of a sport of chargers so I'm a little bit like board member Garcia a little bit in a in a questioning mode in terms of what it is that we might do I mean I I love the fact that we have some students I mean and thank you very much for your son great you know I think it's fantastic these kids are special and and so it's hard for me to decide how to do these things you know because we don't want to put special education kids out on the whatever you know and and I think it is to speak a little bit to my Hoover folks here

[01:50:00]
is there any according to what I understand a little bit it is difficult to take kids who are special education kids out of their environment that they get used to it is difficult to do that and particularly kids with autism kids that have special things and and so we have to be cognizant of that you know in terms of what you're doing here for example so I think again and then we're going to go on to the next song about the contract yourself and I assumed that that contract is for the two years from July 1st June 30th of 2020

[01:51:00]
through June 30th 2020 when we brought you the recommendations we had some concerns regarding and strategic planning fulfillment of an open governing Council position a they did not have a proper financial audit committee they also locked a chief procurement officer certification and did not have adequate policies and procedures that were unique to the school they have met all of those conditions Prior to us bringing you the contract however since that time the government has resigned from the governing Council leaving another open position and the school has been issued the notice of unsatisfactory performance regarding special education so so when we did

[01:52:00]
play December did we indicated that time I mean it's been what 5 months and it was a lot goes back by in 5 minutes I can't remember did we indicate that you needed to bring back to us the contract itself if we approve the contract and I mean the question was did we ask because there were these concerns at that time for you to bring it back to us for reconsideration is that kind of why we're getting it again Mr President when you did not approve the contract do you approve the renewal and approved me to negotiate the contract once these conditions I'm with you okay thank you but we still had to have the contract come back and if we don't approve the contract and let me talk let me go to you talk

[01:53:00]
what about the contract itself and what it is that our possible options are regarding the contract okay and I think again from what I understand what you're saying is we could actually vote on the contract yes or no or we could indicate that we want you to come back to us at some time here in the near future to see if you have resolved some of these other issues you said you've had some conversations about the side effects report maybe that can be clarified a little bit more I don't know it's up to the board I think in terms of what we think we want to do on that but let's go on to the next item which is talking about the contract Mr President members of the board and the volume for the school and did approve me to negotiate a contract and performance framework goals with the school once the conditions that were met on the actions they have

[01:54:00]
proper financial policies and procedures that have been reviewed by our business manager they do have a chief procurement officer they do have an operating finance and audit committee that is in line with State Statute they did fill a governing Council position and they did provide us with strategic plan however since that time another governing council member has resigned which was their board chair Mr Don Duran and the school has been issued this on notice of unsatisfactory performance so the timing isn't perfect but we have to do my due diligence and as your authorizing representative and so I understand it's it is a conundrum we have Debbie Dr marmol and I have had many conversations about what do we do and we have to be straight up and to play this exactly the way

[01:55:00]
contract is designed to do so we have we have from May 16th to June 30th so my question to you is in that time frame in your opinion do you think that some of these issues that you brought up can actually be resolved can be brought back to us with that information and satisfactory enough for us to actually at least vote on a contract with your Mr President and members of the board on superintendent the only thing that I can see between now and June 30th would help us to move forward with would be an accepted corrective action plan so that we would then monitor next year I do not expect the school to make significant progress and implementing the systems and for us to be able to test them out we need to allow time for the correctional

[01:56:00]
directive action plan to be developed tested put into place and for us to do the appropriate monitoring so that would be the only difference between not making a decision now and waiting for the correct address to the principal do you believe you can get it corrected action plan accepted in at that time frame yes we have already worked on a draft and I'll be working with Patricia to find it and so and we are working with an IEP specialist who is also rewriting and doing addendums and amendments to the IEPs that need correction and we're hoping to make significant progress with that so that is are in compliance before the start of school year

[01:57:00]
governing Council position at our meeting this past Monday night I just forgot to tell Dr Escobedo is that Logan's dad he's our governing council president know we have five governing council members now so I just hadn't told Joseph about that yet when you know in the same manner in which I like to have our public education department work with us to make sure that we are giving time to do corrective action to in fact I like to give an opportunity to see if corrective actions can actually be accepted in place so my kind of recommendation would be for us to postpone this

[01:58:00]
contract approval until I say the middle of June maybe one of our June meetings and see if you guys can come back with a corrective action plan is accepted that would allow us to I think have a little more information in terms of that that's kind of my thought now if that's if that's okay with the board if it isn't okay to the board that's I'm open to that as well board thoughts on that I'm okay with that I just you know what you said before about how we don't take that provide service well it's part of the whole nonsensical nature of how this is set up because

[01:59:00]
when a student walks into Hoover Hoover opens its stores wide and says welcome you are our student theoretically that should be the case of Charters they're taking public money although the governing board is appointed there is nothing Democratic about the governing board although they take public money and and they are responsible just as any Traditional School should be in meeting the needs of a student that walks in the door and when we look at the demographics of most charter schools that is absolutely not the case they clearly don't do that one of the things that I think makes us more reluctant to Simply slam the door in the restaurant is that there is a conscious attempt to meet the needs of students with IEPs and to have extraordinary

[02:00:00]
it needs and so it makes us a little more reluctant to say sorry the door is closed but the fact is this school has an obligation just like every other school and APS has an obligation yeah I think it was a good comments any other comments or what are you what's the board's wishes here with regard to this idea of the contract what are your thoughts Peggy well I'm just I mean is that even I mean we're talking about time they need time for something to happen time giving somebody a month is not a lot of time anyhow when you're thinking about time in a school and actions being taken place in you being able to see changes I don't think a month is enough they certainly wouldn't be able to implement a corrective action

[02:01:00]
play what what we're talking about is to have a corrective action plan with with the pieces in place that would in fact say I think if you can implement this then that would satisfy what we're trying to trying to do now are we willing to give you 2 years to try to do that or not that's really the question so you know my first question is is can you even get it is acceptable if you can't do that then I say okay then probably we don't want to go ahead with the contractor but I also want to see that school is also growing their enrollment also which has I have not seen at the school since I've been on the board either so that's all a very big I think we do have the

[02:02:00]
a question of how do we service the students you know I mean that is an important thing and so if we believe that we can service those students better as part of our system and work with the school to do that that would be an obligation for us vulnerable students unless you're very careful about how you do that and so the question of how we do that the question is are they getting the

[02:03:00]
first I want to say thank you for your efforts you know the idea if I understand it correctly on how sort of the concept of charter schools begin was that we would have an opportunity for these schools to try things do things learn things and share them in terms of what they've learned with us so that we could do some of those things as well I just feel like it's hard to get this school out of the box so to speak I would like us to bring them back in six months and see if we have a correction plan that has been implemented if we're consistently moving forward if the school is consistently moving forward I was not happy with the financial challenge

[02:04:00]
but then came to find out that well it wasn't that big and it got smaller and now it sounds like you're in good shape it's hard to run a school it's hard to run a school district but we I think as a board are kind of in need of an incubator school work with our special ed Department as part of our corrective action plan to move things forward we did that for one charter school we took over their finances for two years if I remember correctly and they seem to be okay but it's it's still very we don't stand on Solid Ground necessarily because of the challenges of of how this has been set up and so my hope is that we would be able to bring him back in six months see how

[02:05:00]
Define and you know notice should be very clear in your minds that if we don't move forward then we're going to have to pull the Charter customer assistance we have to actually have a contract in place by July 1st and that would be a contract for 2 years according to the renewal that we did maybe we can make it one year but but the point being I guess is that you know I mean we have to do something before July 1st so we decided against this then it's ultimately really unfair to them because we did give them we did so that's I mean I understand the reason and I understand the rationale but it is really kind of unfair because they are thinking well they're going to be okay for two years so that's the other side too I mean Google

[02:06:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:07:00]
the other concern that I have here is the amount of time and effort that our district is giving to like supporting this administratively when we are not the governing Council for it we don't have that

[02:08:00]
possibility for the actual implementation so so I'm concerned about the time and effort in our ability and our capacity even if we put them on a corrective action plan how much effort is that going to require on our resources so that we can follow that because if they do come into place and we have a corrective action plan or it's conditionally approved or whatever and within six months let's say it's you know it's not satisfactory the performance is still not satisfactory I'm wondering the amount of time that it's taking for us to monitor up to that point so that we can assure that all of this is going to occur so that's one of my areas of concern in this because I I don't I don't know how large this is I'm trying to think of like all the other stuff that's on our plate in terms of what our school district is already having to do and this is the responsibility of a governing Council and I'm what I'm struggling with is that you had a 40% increase you had students that were coming in with disab

[02:09:00]
he needs and yet you didn't fill the positions so I mean that's where I'm struggling in my mind because I'm I'm not understanding why the governing Council wasn't addressing that immediately when you when the need was like glaring you down and like it's just right there right in front of you so so my question is Joseph in terms of like our ability to to Really sustain that and support this we'll miss you I can only speak for myself and I've been in this position for two years this is the first time to my knowledge that the charter school office has put a issued a notice of unsatisfactory performance we have issued three this year one corrective action plan for school of financial concerns and I can tell you that I have spent a tremendous amount of time and about 10 minutes to the school about 20 meeting with the school so a corrective action plan is very time

[02:10:00]
however that doesn't mean that I am not going to do my job and my due diligence as you're authorizing agent to follow through on this it is what we need to do and so I'm you know it does take a lot of time however you know we need to make sure that they're into compliance and so if they get a corrective action plan we will monitor it until it the last piece of paper shows that they are fully executed and then we will continue monitoring it and are annuals and so we are putting the processes and systems in place that you know frankly for 20 years we have not done with Fidelity okay I will entertain a motion to do something somebody wants to put up a motion

[02:11:00]
can you add a couple of comments please in full transparency on Monday you will be approving a full budget for this district and the charter schools I'd like to tell you what you're going to see on the restaurant basically they were funded in this current year on 82 students they are funded next year on 7 1 1

[02:12:00]
make sure that you have that information before you took action thank you thank you I mean you can motion to deny the contractors so we have a motion to move it to sometime in our next meeting in June and one that you can authentically OK Google

[02:13:00]
all in favor please say hi any opposed no okay let's have a roll call to make sure we've got it totaled Lorenzo Garcia radio

[02:14:00]
actually exists and that was one of the the questions that we

[02:15:00]
we had and the other one was maybe we need to let the board know a little bit more about what this program is all about and what good results it has what research it has so I'm going to turn this over to Lucinda and to Sandy and we got a little bit of a presentation here and I know they can get through that pretty quickly but thank you very much and I know it's late but it will be quick thank you president period and it really really supports has an

[02:16:00]
education component of how parents can support their preschoolers in their early elementary students if they have articulation problems in some language concerns so these two ladies that are here with us tonight Sandy Maine right here in Amy Witt right here have been instrumental in getting this program off the ground we've been doing it for quite a few years and what we are really want to do is increase the information about this program to more families because this fits in with the whole child and this fits in with the early childhood education model and it prevents many of our children from being placed into program so I would like to introduce Amy in Sandy and I don't know is going to start

[02:17:00]
facilitated interventions and I think that it's important to kind of explain what that means and what we're doing my colleague Amy and I have been running these programs in APS since 2005 and we have had wonderful support from the special education leadership because this really does bring in that parent component it really looks at how we can make parents Partners in their children's Communications services so our programs that we run were developed by a program called Intervention and it is not for profit charitable organization basically they develop these programs based on most current research and then they trained clinicians around the world myself as well as Amy have an extra job where we actually work for the Hannah and we do get to travel nationally and internationally to train others

[02:18:00]
listen to program so we feel pretty strongly about it we think it's a great program so what is this whole parent facilitated intervention actually mean it's really talking about what is it that we think is the parents role in their children's education and there has been research on this for many many years this is just a current a current one that says parents are the experts and they want to do right by their child and you've definitely heard that from a few of the parents who spoke here tonight if any of you have children and any of your children struggled in anything in school you know but not knowing what to do about that is almost debilitating it's so overwhelming so what these programs do so well is they actually give parents the skills that they need to help their child develop skills so there has been a lot of research that says that parent training really does work what they say is that with coaching from a therapist with a therapist who really is able to

[02:19:00]
present information to an adult learner that we see parents are as effective or more effective than clinicians in supporting their children so we know that the families need to be involved they need to be involved early and they need to be given appropriate training all right put on my glasses make sure I'm not missing anything sorry in addition this style of training is used as the initial intervention for families in a lot of different countries and places where we don't have the same time lines in place for education and support services many families are put on a wait list for many years before they receive services that is actually why these programs were first developed is that they are so powerful they work as a standalone intervention whether the children are getting other services or not so when we run the Hannon programs here in APS we are really looking at three different pieces the first is we're trying to

[02:20:00]
locate the parents in a series of 78 group sessions the parents come together with us for classes and we give them information and strategies about their child's communication so as as mentioned before we work with parents of children who have language delays who are maybe not yet communicating or not able to communicate very clearly we also work with children with social communication delays and autism so it's a huge range and for a parent to know where does my child fall and what's the expected expected next step is really important so we teach them these strategies that they can go home and use in everyday situations and that's really where the intervention comes in so what parents do at every group session is they develop a home plan and that home plan has a goal I want my child to reach this Benchmark while we are doing snack this week that's the goal we have a very set idea of what they want to do and what the strategy is going to be

[02:21:00]
so every time that the parent uses the strategy the child is receiving direct intervention it's just not through a special education provider it's through a parent the other real benefit of this and I think Gene mentioned this earlier is the piece involved where Amy or myself visits with the family and the child they tell us what their plan is and we video tape them using their plan if they need help we give them some coaching remember wait let him talk and then we sit down with the parent right then and there and watch the tape back so the parent can really see oh my gosh when I do this he's able to look at me he smiled and so it's really that self-reflection that's the key and why parents intervention works is the parents don't just hear the information and agree with us that they actually own it so that's where the intervention piece really comes in the last reason that these parents is very powerful is the support component

[02:22:00]
so as I mentioned before if you've ever been a parent of a child who had any issues learning it's the last thing you want to talk about it at dinner party you don't really want to share that with all the other people you know yeah my child is still struggling in math you don't really want to talk about it when you're talking about children with very significant delays these parents are often feeling very isolated so when they come to these programs they really start to interact with others who are experiencing similar challenges and you may have seen a couple of the parents like hugging and saying hello out back there when they came in because they've become a support system for each other it's phenomenal to watch and it's very exciting for myself so overall an entire program like this where the parents and having a semester it's about run run run run run run run run run more than one at a time but when we think about these programs they're actually very cost-effective and

[02:23:00]
and if you think about it if I'm running a group session and I have seven or eight of those and it's about 2 and a half hours for a group and we usually have somewhere between 6:00 and 12:00 in that class that is only taking me about 20 hours out of my work to do that with this family if I gave each one of those families that same amount of time we'd be talking at 80 hours I mean it would be using up so much more of a resource let's face it speech therapist in the district are resources so we're doing it in a very cost-effective manner by working with the families the other reason that it is very cost-effective however is that it really increases the intensity of intervention for these kiddos so as you have probably heard from families whose children are receiving special education of more more more more more direct service is what is really going to make a difference what we actually know is more more more more service in the natural situation makes the biggest difference the kids get

[02:24:00]
the most benefit by having these strategies interwoven in their day so when parents attend the program we send them home with lots of home plans I will tell you that we ask them to only do the home plan 5 to 10 minutes at a time but each week they get another one's two or three they get a lot of different activities so what I put on there is that during the course of the program typically parents are working with their child directly with a plan in place with a goal in mind about an hour a day minimum and I would guess that for a lot of families it's a lot more of a way of life but that's 60 hours of intervention over the course of 12 weeks that's amazing that's a lot of intervention so really the amount of time for the district is not a huge investment of time but for the child it's up to 80 hours of service so it's a huge difference and it is no wonder then that we see our children make a lot of progress

[02:25:00]
what's in a short amount of time because they are getting a lot of intervention the other reason that this works so well really speaks to the idea of generalization so generalization is when a child can learn to do a skill in one setting and they can do it somewhere else one of the biggest complaints is for kids having a hard time moving something from school to home or home to school so this definitely fits in with the superintendent's Big Five developing the whole child and working on that family engagement generation is built into this program because activities are happening in the natural environment some of the parents mentioned the idea that it's really nice if Amy or myself is able to meet with the teacher as well and we do that when invited so that we really are able to say this is working really well at home how can you do this at school and vice versa for a teacher to tell us this works really well at school can we get the parents on board with that so we get a lot of generalization in the program basically

[02:26:00]
what happens as the parents go through the training is they parents really build their confidence this is truly a parent empowerment program where they believe that they truly are an equal partner in their child's education and that is the power of the program they recognize that what they are doing is crucial for their child's School Success so every one of our programs is evidence-based I do not I'm not a statistic and so I don't have you know that kind of information on each child but we do show progress for every child so this is an example of the evidence for one of our programs called it takes two to talk and it takes two to talk we work with parents of children with language delays and one of the things that is measured is how many words do they have at the beginning of the program and at the end

[02:27:00]
original research on the program at the Hannon Center showing how great a difference it was for the children in the program over the course of 3 months how how much more their vocabulary increased and that is the kind of data that we do keep on our kids for the most part in APS what we have seen and it takes two to talk is our children of double or triple their vocabulary in that course of that 3 months if they are at the point of using words we see lots of other growth as well that's one of the areas that we measure one reason that this is so helpful is those young children who have that language delay if they make this much progress that quickly from Services a lot faster and are not still receiving speech language services in elementary school we also run two programs for parents of children with autism or social communication delays and we measure their progress in different

[02:28:00]
vocabulary kind of goal we're looking at how they use their language functionally with other people so in more than words are program has four stages of communication development so we tend to look at what are all the different steps what are all the different goals that a child should be able to do before they move to the next step so this light is simply an example of one of those students I had a child at a particular stage called the early Communicator stage at the beginning of the program he only had two of the 12:00 and by the end he had seven of the 12th so that's a big jump in just that short amount of time I forgot to mention on the last one how many kids we have worked with so in it takes two to talk we have worked with 149 children since 2005 this was the first program we started in the district and it was started as just one small class so we have over time these programs dramatically

[02:29:00]
at this point in more than words we didn't start this program until 2007 and we have worked with 131 children in the district and have seen amazing progress and a lot of parent responses responses that they really have appreciated and learned a lot from the programs so in our last program for children on the autism spectrum or with social communication delays we look at several different things basically how well do they take turns in conversation these are those really verbal kids that are typically mainstreamed in elementary school but are still having problems lots of breakdowns on the playground lots of not wanting to do with the teacher says most of that is rooted in difficulties with something we call theory of mind which is understanding that other people have different desires thoughts and beliefs than you do so if you don't understand that other people are happy when you give them a turn on the slide you're not going to give anybody a turn because you like it you don't want to share

[02:30:00]
one of the things we measure is these five different stages of tuning in so this again is an example it's just a bar graph of one of my students each each one of these stages has three steps and so you'll see through the course of the program kids move through these steps you can't move to the next stage until you understand this one and the parents learn how to support these different goals some of the things that parents say about that program are pretty exciting things like you know what he finally asked me what I wanted for dinner and it's very exciting to see these changes in the family Dynamic we started this program in 2011 and since that time we have worked with 544 to get the word out about our programs it takes two to talk and More Than Words 10 to be targeted

[02:31:00]
mostly to preschool talkability is end of preschool and End Elementary School I will say this is where we're lacking the most in advertising these are the parents who come to the classes and you heard some of them say this like I don't understand why I never heard of this I've had six IEPs how did no one mention it so that's where we're wondering like where can we make sure that information is getting to them sooner because they might have benefited from some support along the way so those are the programs that we are currently running in Albuquerque Public Schools in addition we did run a parent program for parents of children who fail and articulation screening in preschool so in preschool children screening and then they receive an evaluation determine if they need direct Services Program this is this was

[02:32:00]
optional if parents chose to do it they came to it they came to 1 to 2 group sessions they had individual visits just like the other programs we talked about with video feedback and one of the big things that they learned is what's typical when you think about how children pronounce words in preschool typical is a really big range so simply to hear that yes it's actually okay that your child still says wascally wabbit is very comforting that's what we say at this age it's okay but what we found in that program we ran that for five years and we worked with 251 kids in that program and 138 of them did not go on for an evaluation they were age-appropriate after two months we didn't have to evaluate them so this was a huge Time Saver very cost-effective and it empowered parents again to not have that awful feeling if I'm not doing enough they knew what they could do in addition we did run some

[02:33:00]
grams for teachers along the way we ran a program called learning language and loving it that went across an entire school year teachers again learned strategies we went out to their classrooms and videotaped them and gave them feedback on how well they were really getting their children to interact and engage in classroom activities and then that program changed into something called teacher talk that didn't have quite the number of sessions for the teachers but they still receive the training one nice thing about these programs is they linked very closely to what the parents learn and so they were able to speak the same language we definitely still have some teachers in the developmental preschool programs who took the courses and they refer family to us all the time because they say Hannah is the greatest stuff this is the best information you need to know this so we have been running the program since 2005 one of the things to think about is what was the cost to APS for all of that

[02:34:00]
so from about 2005 to 2007 was the largest chunk of cost there was probably about $5,000 spent on training Personnel we needed to go to the trainings to learn how to teach the parents in addition we were able to spend about $3,000 we think on books that way the parents are not required to purchase their own book there is no cost to the parents for this program so we have a lending library and that was paid for through the special education department in Edition when we were training teachers we had to have substitute pay so that was one of the costs as far as annual costs though we make copies for each of our classes and

[02:35:00]
play leadership has seen what an important program this is and how well it supports their goals as well as the entire District academic master plan and continues to fund our positions to provide the service because they think it's very important so it's been a really nice thing to have that kind of support So In addition to telling you a little bit about this information Dr Pearcy did ask me to talk about what else could we do with this idea in Albuquerque Public Schools so with the great support of our special education leadership we will continue to run the programs for our parents of children with language delays and autism spectrum or social communication delays we are talking about possibly returning to the parent intervention for tier 2 interventions for children with articulation as well and one other thing that I just wanted to present to you is there is an early literacy training that could

[02:36:00]
do you support the master academic plan in the idea of early learning and thinking about those critical components of Early Childhood literacy so there is a program through Hannon called ABC and Beyond and in that training teacher would get trained in this and they would learn all of those critical components of pre-K literacy basically as far as cost to the district we would probably need to train one to two teachers in this program then they would be trained in a parent component to this program so that they can actually train the parents to do these things and that I think is the exciting piece is much like we've talked about with our other parents parents would know how to be equal Partners in their child's education so in the parent training the the parents would learn the same critical skills and they would have strategies like oh my gosh how do I really build print awareness when I'm

[02:37:00]
just doing a shared reading activity again they get a lot of support a lot of coaching from their trained teachers so cost to APS would be again training personnel and purchasing books this would be a piece of a general education side I'm just presenting the idea that it is available let's see so Mr President and board members I would like to open it up to any questions you have at this moment you have any questions for me thank you thank you very much so with most of our programs there is not a specific age so it takes two to talk and More Than Words we usually work with preschool students but if we have a child who's maybe eight or nine years old and is still not yet communicating with words they might still be appropriate for it takes two to talk so we open the door for

[02:38:00]
call Early Elementary for the talkability program that usually starts around Age 4 and we work with kids usually up to about 11 or 12:00 we usually stay in the elementary school ages with the articulation program that is just for 3 and 4 year olds maybe 5 year olds if they're not in kindergarten yet other than English we do not what we do is if parents are comfortable attending the classes in English then when they do their individual visits with their child they speak to their child and whatever language they use and they just help us figure out what they said when we're trying to give them some support and coaching we have at times had interpreters attend the classes with us to support some of the families and for a short time we did run it takes two to talk in Spanish excuse me

[02:39:00]
but my concern is that we have a number of students who do not speak English and parents who don't speak English and unless you have a very intentional effort that you're making you're going to get the response you got so my hope is that that can be on your to-do list as you move forward when are the programs offered like what time of day too for parents so we offer programs during the school day so that they don't have to arrange child care and in the evening so we basically we hold orientation sessions we invite the parents in and we say okay which program is best for your child

[02:40:00]
what time of day is best for you and that's actually how we make the decision each semester which one we're going to be running so this last semester Amy and myself were both running evening programs because that worked better for our families last semester I had an equal number of parents who needed morning and evening for more than words so I actually ran the same class twice in one day but I wanted to make sure that they all had access to it and where were those classes offered it really depends on what location we can get oftentimes are nighttime classes are held here at City Center because it is close to the freeway we have held them at many different School sites depending on what is closest for the families and what rooms are available so that has dictated some of course we've also used off school sites things like the New Mexico Educators Training Center I think I've held a couple of things at the Autism Center so it just depends on where we can find a room that is going to be workable for the families and would you say that the students

[02:41:00]
I received the services is it just pretty much been across the whole city or is it one nice thing is that Amy lives on the west side of town and I live on the east side of town and it's often been a little bit easier for us when we are providing those home visits that we have been on opposite sides of the town but we have worked with families from the very far north west into the East mountains I have had several families area so yeah we've covered the whole city we typically have between 6 and 12 family in a group session we prefer to have it at least six to run a class and pretty hard but we do if we have that many parents interested of course we still do that I mean we always talked about

[02:42:00]
Kaufman but finding structures for the fork is not always easy so this is impressive I think the challenge is increasing the numbers and getting the word out I mean how many more parents could you really accommodate though I mean there's two there's just two of you correct right there are a couple of others in the district that are trained in the programs that are not currently running programs honestly it really depends on what else we are doing in our work so at a certain point Amy and myself were both full-time doing hand and we were running multiple classes at a time we are now doing evaluations part-time and running the parent training so it really depends on what where do we need the resources if we had more parents who were asking for the classes that is certainly something we would talk about with special education leadership is to how much do we need to do but honestly I want a full class every time I run a class

[02:43:00]
every time I have families come to my class they say I can't believe there's not that everyone in my son's class isn't here and I think that's one of the issues I would like to make it more accessible I'd like to make it easier for families to attend but I also just want to make sure they all know that it's available to them right I think just getting the word out so are you trying to get the word out and you know better way we are talking about some different ways to do it next year yeah and that's something that we're discussing with leadership like what will be the best ways to do this currently what we do is we send Flyers to all the beach language pathologist in the district we send them to every teacher of a developmental preschool program and every teacher of an Autism specific I mean social communication class in the district up through grade five so we asked that they send the Flyers home with the parents in addition we have trained our early childhood IEP teachers and they often mentioned the programs

[02:44:00]
and the parents receive information then they contact the team contacts us and then we follow up with those families and say hey do you want to come so we do a lot of personal invitations as well it sounds wonderful and I think we should try to grow successful programs and stop those that aren't so your sounds like one that should grow thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you one last thing you didn't really love as much as I think program for example I think you have told me before that Canada uses this is so precious

[02:45:00]
component as well I forgot to write down what they were so I am sorry Mr President I think the point is is that I might talk about this a lot about the ability to sustain a program where we got two people here plus maybe a couple others so what you can do is what you can do and you can sustain that because you know what you're doing and but it's limited in terms of the number of people I think I mentioned and maybe this is something you can bring the possibility of using Synergy to get well I don't know that everybody can just get on Synergy Target in other words if we know students that need these kinds of services or would benefit mostly from these Services could you maybe call that and make sure that you get it sent to those parents in terms of making sure it's targeted to them to say hey here's

[02:46:00]
program that you might be interested in and if you need more information please contact here that way we would have a much larger to the parents cuz you know you sent it out to our Sops and everybody else and yeah maybe they get it out maybe they don't but if you can get it directly to the parents I think that probably would be a little bit better strategy to make sure that they at least know such a thing exists then they can when they come and they say well somebody sent me this thing on Hannah what's that all about you know and they at least ask the question so I think that's maybe possibility so those are good good things and and again how do you build capacity what's your building

[02:47:00]
and if we can get the parents involved and I know you guys in Hoover know this if you get the parents involved and what you're trying to do you're going to have a lot more success than if you're just trying to do it yourself cuz you only have a certain amount of time they have a lot more time and so if you can get this coordinated so that you get a lot more service so to speak and then the parents who sometimes just don't know what to do they don't know what to do sometimes and they need to have these kinds of ideas of what can I do and so I think that's you know again where it goes it depends on what we have for funds we have to do things but you know we talk all the time about early leadership you talk about early learning and then we have a program over here and another program over here another program over here and I never know what are those going to do for me you know and I said well we have a program here that has great research that has great results

[02:48:00]
why not try that you know and that's pretty unique that's that's thinking differently than we've been thinking of thinking about so thank you very much for what you're doing and I appreciate that so thank you thank you so we do have we do have a few more things on our plate here tonight so we have board member comments

[02:49:00]
given to us correct correct and so we have that information now so I said item e which consideration proof of qualification 89 million dollars for the Thompson Construction incorporation for Montessori in the Rio Grande charter school phase 2 we had the discussion we just didn't have the qualifications

[02:50:00]
in that item 16 points but I don't think it altered the outcome so but it was member number one right now but I don't I don't think it affected management plan it was better than that's the 110 percent

[02:51:00]
an app is the consideration for the qualification proposal and bid for 9 plus million dollars at applicable taxes submitted by Thompson Construction for the Janet cotton school for the integrated arts this phase one thank you very much and thank you Google for example who are blind people who can't hear people who can't see well that's why they need to be able to do this and it's

[02:52:00]
difficult to have the voice over on this for people who have to have the verbal aspect of this you know speaking to them as to what it is all about and you can imagine that taking one of these tables write how exactly am I going to do a voiceover of these tables to tell you what's in these tables you kind of need somebody who understands about how to explain tables not just verbal communication and so it's a little bit of an iffy thing to try to get this done so that was one of the issues but I think again we can still get paper copies we can still see that and if you can make sure that we get an electronic copy so that can blow it up and see it you know a little bit that's kind of what we need to have as a board but you have a larger problem so I appreciate you doing this and I hope you weren't insulted thank you thank you we'll go on to the the two items that we removed from our

[02:53:00]
consent calendar when was the 78.2 that's the approval of the Board of Education authorization the superintendent escape this memorandum of understanding to accept so to speak tentatively this donation of 150 acres pending lots of analysis and other things so Peggy wanted to move that off so we will take a motion to accept that and then we'll vote on it do you have a motion and a second and all my favorite places just says that APS won't involve itself in activities that aren't directly related to its Mission as an educational services provider so that somebody else deciding for us what we think are educational services and the fact that I think it was number six where we have to start building by 2023 or we

[02:54:00]
is it being reverted back to to wall and I mean we're taking the land off property tax rolls when we don't even know that we may have the money so that also affects us so that's why I'm voting now and I think those are issues for us to make sure we keep in mind you know as we go go forward please finding our mission that was my concern when I read it but as I understood it we were saying this is what our staff were saying this is what we're about as an educational

[02:55:00]
which is the proof of the ELA instructional materials for elementary schools and that was The Benchmark Advanced that we had and so I'll entertain a motion for that and have a second and all the favorite places to us I'm at the end of my rope like I mean it was like why did they adopt this there's so many holes that it's 50% there but not all the way I'm just feeling so anxious this isn't about about kids the scripted teacher guide book The pacing is slow as I'm desperate

[02:56:00]
how's the veteran teacher of 34 years I mean it's like the passages are boring this is not about kids there are so many editing errors and incorrect titles and might be good for a first-year teacher but it was too long for seasoned veterans and I mean I found a few Pros you know script is helpful lessons address the ccss we've been asking for a curriculum that goes along and the program addresses them but the texts aren't engaging the timing is off about vocabulary needs to be taught the assessments are too involved if you care just about assessments this is the program to have and it just kind of went through some of the things that they asked little six-year-old 7 year olds to their prompts one of them was 7 year old had to write a personal letter to someone from the point of view of a smokejumper imagine taking on the perspective that even

[02:57:00]
let's have a hard time with much less having a 6 and 7 year old doing that another one was a first grade read aloud was about a guy in South Africa who created a Surf Club to keep teenage delinquents off the street I could go I mean this was a teacher said I could go on and on but I'm on my 35 minute lunch break run run away as fast as you can this program so far away from being developmentally appropriate for primary so that's coming from teachers so okay I will go on to the rest of the approval of the consent calendar items do I have emotions

[02:58:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:59:00]
we're in a high position as a board lots of times and I know finances in a hard position and it comes down to numbers sometimes and people start moving things around because it seems logical and and it makes it work because there's this jigsaw puzzle of how do we how do we have people and how do we have money and where can things fit and we end up dealing with issues like you know just trying to make all of the pieces fit together but when we do that we lose sight of that relationship that really is the foundation for what happens for kids and so I'm not I don't know what the solution is we don't have it up here but over and over again in the morning that we can pull in people and talk about put the problem on the table this is the problem how are we going to do it and usually the people who are the practitioner

[03:00:00]
find the solution that they need to make it work and so if we can just step back and do that I don't know anything about the details except for what we heard tonight but but I do think that the problem on the table and let practitioners really grapple with it to figure out how do you maintain the relationship and and look for the solution that does address the specific problems that we have and that's it I think it was incredibly important to have Hoover and Madison talk about this transition and the information that they just learned about and and Mr Houston I'd love to hear more about this transition in this proposal and and what it looks like and because we do realize how important relationships are as it comes to education so I just again

[03:01:00]
Echo your sentiments and really think Hoover and Madison for their their passion and their energy for being here tonight and sharing that with us and and letting us know is so important for us to hear your voice so thank you and I agree I just don't think that any of the teachers out there from Hoover and I'm sure Madison and Hayes the same thing you don't want to risk hurting any of those children and if moving them is going to hurt them we need to think about making the decision that's going to be best for the kids not for the adults but what's best for the kids so if I think one of you mentioned why don't we start with sixth graders that makes a whole lot a whole lot more sense and I think that would be a lot less hurtful but I also don't know the details but that I mean moving them and risking hurting any any child goes against anything that any educator would ever ever do and we don't often hear the team

[03:02:00]
sometimes not that folks work in silos but to actually have folks come and talk about having established a family which is also a team you know it's really good to hear it too so much and I think that is went to go talk to them already so yes yes but thank you

[03:03:00]

I hope that the administration can work with our Hoover folks and and their medicine folks and let's figure it out let's figure it out let's figure out how this works you know can't be that hard can't be that hard let's figure out how it works how to make it work better you know that's kind of the idea and I know you can do that so we'll make sure that you guys can do that I I do have to mention a little what an incredible display of unique creative Innovative work by our kids and the collaboration we have with you and him with what I call real teacher preparation this is this is what it's about this is where we have to go and so it's more than just a really good job and having some good education

[03:08:00]
but it's more than that because because it's how we ought to have our teachers educating our kids and that preparation process and we're working hard with UNM with your College of Education in terms of how to do that and how that apprenticeship works and how those things work so I think it's really critical that we that we get a little bit out there about what we're doing and that program because that's that's where it's really about so I really appreciate that greatly and you know I would like to very much thank you born staff I mean you guys are incredible what you did for graduation
