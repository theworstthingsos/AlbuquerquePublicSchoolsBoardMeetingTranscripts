Video ID: JBJeeHPHjHs
==================================================

[00:00:00]
welcome to the finance committee meeting I would like to call the meeting to order Miss King medical place Yolanda Montoya Cordova here they gave me a letter here in young Gonzalez Barbara Peterson Romeo here so our first item for consideration and action is the approval of the November 29th 2023 finance committee meeting agenda I have a motion place I'll move for approval of the November 29th 2023 finance committee meeting agenda thank you yes yes Danielle Gonzales Texas consideration is the approval of the minutes from the finance committee meeting agenda on May 25th 2022 that should say

[00:01:00]
2022 okay August 24th 2022 October 26th 2022 and October 25th 2023 may have a motion to approve the minutes from the finance committee meetings on May 25th August 24th October 26th all of 2022 and October 25th 2023 yes so our next item for consideration and action is the approval of the qualification based proposal and bid in the amount of 4 million 958,000 plus taxes as submitted by Franken construction for coaching elementary school classroom Edition and we

[00:02:00]
for the expenditure for the qualification based proposal and I'm not sure if that's available construction for the 6th classroom Edition at Coach T elementary school and I am open for any questions do we have any questions I just had some follow-up questions

[00:03:00]
I don't know if anybody received them or not I did receive them and responded to them period so I'll just go through real quick cuz there's there's it's really quick anyhow so coaching is currently at 55% building capacity right that's how I understood it's like 55% correct okay and so then the question that I kind of didn't get answered is if coach it is like at 55% capacity are there then Karen are there some like empty classrooms that are being used right now let me look through

[00:04:00]
six vacant portable classrooms that we're going to be removing off the site before construction begins and let's see I think I think you asked if they do art and music in place of portable in Portables and that's yes 19 Portal classrooms that are currently on of the 19th permanent classrooms are any currently unoccupied and all 19 classrooms are utilized for instructions that are going to be removed and then the other two will be removed later as soon as the construction is done so so then the question that I had so there are 376 Elementary H students that are in the attendance boundary and so you believe that all those children were going to be attending coaching okay I'm reading these

[00:05:00]
he said let's see he says that after construction there would be 19 permanent building classrooms plus four new regular classrooms one art classroom and one music classroom that equals 25 that's correct and can you explain how having less than $144 more students will work and he says currently for classrooms unoccupied and the 19th classrooms are not full does that answer your question I'm not sure it does yeah I don't think so oh sorry well it's kind of was just thinking that we're going to end up you know I understand six of those Portables are not being used so I see removing them but now you're going to have less classroom space but you're going expecting more students so I was just confused about there were 27 classrooms right now but after construction they'll still be

[00:06:00]
the 19 per minute classrooms but then they'll just be the four regular and then the music and the art so they'll be less classrooms but they'll be more students so I just wanted like an explanation for how that was going to like how that was going to work with more students it seem confusing to me I think what he's saying is that there are the 19th that they currently have are not full either so I think between the new classrooms and the 19th that aren't quite full the new group of kids will all fit in the in the building at 55% capacity I mean I assume that a lot of those costumes are pretty pretty empty so that's that's just what I just made that assumption and so the only other thing is when it came to the playground there's going to be frank and construction is not going to be doing that relocation of

[00:07:00]
of the playground so somebody else another vendor is going to be doing that after everything all done correct so then Karen is out like really cost effective is that typical of what usually happens that's typical of what usually happens and I think we have found over the years that it is cost-effective not so much on the front end with the capital money but it is on the back end with the risk management side of things because these playgrounds have they're very specialized because they have to have certain fall surfaces and they have to have certain equipment for children and then we have to have ADA accommodations and all of those things and of course when kids are playing sometimes they fall and break their arms and anyway all those things I think it's more the risk management and the liability of them and the fact that they have to be audited and certified for use by children this does become more cost-effective in the long run it may not be immediately

[00:08:00]
and then I'm just hoping I know I looked at the numbers for the 20th day and how low we are so that's also a concern where we thought we were going to be at like 69,000 and I think right now we're at like 65 so then I'm concerned about those you know all those kids getting into that school that they really will be there so thank you thank you period I just have a couple questions about the the funding and the bid process so I did see that there was only there was only one company that came in for the bed so I guess my first question and and I saw I saw your answer that she sent back that this is kind of becoming de facto this is what's

[00:09:00]
but my question is is it is it proper is it within is it proper for us to continue forward with a project if we did only get one bit like do we have a due diligence to wait until we have three two or three beds so that we can do a comparison and my question for that is because it came in at 600 dollars a square foot whereas just a couple months ago we had like Sierra Vista that was around 400.00 a square foot and so I I wonder is this something that we should be pushing forward

[00:10:00]
so we get some economy of scale there this of course is a very small at 6 class rooms only there's not even restrooms in there it's $8,236 square feet so it would be slightly higher it's it's perfectly legal and I'll let renette answer more on that but it's perfectly legal to go to accept a bid from just one bitter and I did call Franklin and they felt very comfortable with their bid they feel very comfortable with the timeline and I'd like to say to that there are several factors that probably caused this to be slightly more expensive and one of them might have been the short construction timeline and the scale of it and there may have been other factors I think they ended up getting only two electrical Subs bidding so they didn't have a lot of choice but

[00:11:00]
that's a lot better than it's been because some of the contractors have gotten just one sub so the subs the sub in particularly electrical Subs in this industry right now are really tight they're just aren't that many I heard yesterday that two more of the big ones are going to go they're going to close their doors after they finish the work they've got so it's just the market and it's very unfortunate and I'm hoping for stabilization but I actually don't think prices are going to go down anytime soon if ever so that was another question I had you said you felt good about the bid you mean in the sense well in the sense that he had more than two bidders on every discipline with the exception of electrical so that shows that it was competitive

[00:12:00]
and the other reason that we know it's competitive is there were I believe three General Contractors that pulled plans and two of them for whatever reason decided not to bid but he doesn't know that so he thinks he's competing against two other General Contractors so he wants to be competitive in order to get the job and then can you just touch One More Time On You know where the use of the SR funds and how how how how how it is an appropriate use of the SR funding to use to move forward with this project yes so the answer is you know one of the acceptable uses for us or funds was Kindergarten and one of the reasons why is because during covid a lot of the parents couldn't

[00:13:00]
get back to work because they didn't have anywhere to put their children so it took a lot longer for us to get back to normal because the they had a lack of care facilities for younger children so it isn't allowable use with Esser for that reason and the other thing I just like to point out with regard to the Esser money and I know that was jumped on so he may want to add something to this but the answer is a way for us to leverage our Capital dollars so as you know we're talking about right now how expensive construction has gotten if we can find alternate sources of money to help Leverage The the woefully inadequate Capital dollars that we have it allows us to do construction projects like coach TV

[00:14:00]
part of our due diligence is to check for response that they are both responsible and responsive so there's a number of forms oftentimes there's a bit Bond that's involved that they have to submit but there's a number of requirements that they need to meet me to even be considered responsive so there is no legal reason you can't receive take one a single bed but there's no reason why if you have you know the time and the desire to go out to bid again thank you very well welcome

[00:15:00]
to modify or maintain an existing space so in this case they are adapting an existing space to the identified needs anything in relation to construction is mandatory to be pre-approved with New Mexico public education department and it is pre-approved there is a form that we're filling out casito and Karen have always provided us with a lot of justification to ensure that we can get we can get those approvals so we don't break ground on anything until we get pre-approval on on on on that okay and this one has been pre-approved or is in the process of being pre-approved not certain on that one Karen do you know I believe it has been the project has been pre-approved and I believe that the construction has been pre-approved too I think it has I'm not 100% sure on that yet

[00:16:00]
call Esther compliance specialist is the point of contact that ensures that all the paperwork is in place before we align the budget for construction okay thank you thank you any other questions yes my question isn't so much about this particular project but just the circumstances again where we have one bidder and and so how can we from a system standpoint looking into the future how can we impact that so I started doing some reading and talking to people and one question I and eventually this conversation will get to

[00:17:00]
our Career Technical education programs and how we can feed a pipeline but first does the do the general contractors and Subs submitting bids do they have registered have a registered apprenticeship program with the state of New Mexico almost all the contractors that we were I'm pretty sure all of them do their is desperate for employees as we are you know so they all have some sort of apprenticeship program and they work with the unions and ABC and ABC all of those organizations are have a program so they're actively searching I'd like to add

[00:18:00]
board members the issue is not just return pipeline for workers it's retention retention of employees is just a big an issue as a pipeline because we are producing workers we could produce more workers but a lot of young people are choosing to leave the state because the amount of jobs out of state in our neighboring states especially Texas Colorado Arizona they are assured of work into the next 40 months while over here you have a job here and a job there and you don't know whether you have another contract with Once one contract is done so retention which has to do with pay but also have to do with our economic well-being we need to have a lot more activity economically

[00:19:00]
for us to retain workers in our system

[00:20:00]
I have not if they have not made application or or received a bid not quite sure about which of those two or if they're both after 3 years they have to start a process over again and and the details of that I guess I don't want to worry about those details but what I do want to focus on is is there some way we can revisit our system of selection to to allow these small contractors to get in the game again even if that means you know coming together with with them to hear their concerns and so that we can work together because we don't want to pass them

[00:21:00]
if there's a possibility that we can increase the number of bids and so I'm just I'm suggesting that that we move in that direction somehow that we get in touch with these small contractors to revisit the selection process that's all thank you

[00:22:00]

[00:34:00]

[00:35:00]
7.5 million and a utilizing Capital SB 9 and S refunds happy to answer any questions I just had a question that I had sent in about Esther funds being used and I know there is that is what they can be used on when it comes to safety and when it comes to Plumbing etcetera but the question that I had was with one of the with a couple of the answers that I received is that do you ever answer this question or you saying that the use of these funds on these upgrades at the different schools so this is about Plumbing you know air quality plumbing Etc that that would lead to increased academic outcomes then for students at the schools that are receiving these upgrades or have received them both of them

[00:36:00]
sometimes I might be able to assist with answering this question the answer funding is meant to address and mitigate data documented results of the pandemic in this case access to clean water and access to clean air is is one of the identified needs and and allowability within Esser so Plumbing or anything related to bring the school building up to date let's say or to improve it and give our address to the health of our students is highly recommended I do understand that but to say that it will lead to increased academic outcomes and then just the implication that students in these buildings don't have access to clean clean clean air clean water

[00:37:00]
I don't think that that's what was meant because I don't believe that our kids are drinking bad water or have really horrible are like I would hope that that's not the case but that's the implication which is was alarming to me and I understand upgrades are important but just the way it was written and then I mean our families to believe that these upgrades are going to help you know catch their kids up like really know but I do believe board member Miller gone that these are schools that need to be improved we know that having clean water and efficient are absolutely reduce the amount of contagion and that was one of the big pushes of the extra funding was to improve our building site so that we would not have an issue if another contagion or a pandemic

[00:38:00]
this is a unique opportunity we have just like schools across the country to improve some of the areas that a disease could develop so we can say we have clean water today we want to have clean water 10/20 years from now as well and so that's sort of the work we know a few years ago we had issues with some lead in our water we had to do a massive upgrade on our pipes you know those problems can still come back and so by improving the facilities and creating a space where kids can be healthier and I do think you could see outcomes of improves no no no and our kids drinking bad water now no but we have come up and we have to do like an emergency 350,000

[00:39:00]
to get ahead of some of these problems and that's what I think you see here so I didn't read this as carefully as you did I didn't see the the language I understand your concern but I do think it's a very justifiable and and it makes sense in the bigger picture of creating a safe environment for kids I just want to know that our kids are consuming clean water that the air is clean so we're kind of saying that is not the case so then how much would it cost to make sure that that happens because nobody wants to be told that the child is doesn't have access to clean air or clean water that like it was frightening to parents you know it's it's frightening to me so I just want to know how much what do we have to do to ensure that that's not happening at certain schools well I read it and I'll let you jump in real give me a moment so obviously this is something we've continued to do in the past this isn't a

[00:40:00]
project by any means we were just allocated the SR finding to pay for it previously we were spending 8.6 million hour at 7.5 for these next three years so we actually have a significant savings listed there and to me this is something that we're maintaining it's not saying that we had an issue but in order to not have an issue we have to be we talk about being proactive versus reactive and making sure we catch problems before they arise that's how I interpreted this but I'll turn it over to I'm trying to read I don't say sorry one of the things with these projects that we just completed with our phones this past the year and a half and we will continue until December of next year is that is that we have schools that have galvanized piping throughout the schools and as you know with old

[00:41:00]
galvanized piping it tends to Leach iron which then tints the water the water is perfectly safe but it also tends the water and people don't like to drink that type of water so what we completed in the last year and a half is over 23 schools we've repaired 23 schools for all the domestic water we have a few more schools left to do that in a preventative matter of getting rid of all the galvanized piping and so this next year from now to December will be finishing the last 10 schools and we will be in which we will use for funds for because that's exactly what they were used for is to build the quality of the water and not have a problem so we're well on our way to finishing all the schools that have galvanized piping within the district and with this windfall of money it was something that we could never have done in the master plan and 10

[00:42:00]
so that's that's great that is a good thing that makes me feel and I'm sure a lot of parents a lot better so we still will have to continue this maintenance though right John like we'll have to keep keep that up but we're not going to have this money so we're going to have to make sure to keep maintaining this to make sure everything is safe and you know not tinted weird or whatever we're going to have that money right well that's why we're changing out all the piping now so we're getting rid of all the galvanized piping that's in the domestic water systems at our schools and so this will take care of all the 37 schools that have the old galvanized piping that have the capability of leeching so once we're finished with this we won't have that problem anymore in the district with old galvanized piping thank you thank you any other questions

[00:43:00]
and I also have a school that I need to talk to you about as far as the water is concerned but so you said the estimated purchase for 3 years is 7.5 million using Capital SB 9 and Sr I'm assuming we're starting with the SR first yes we will use Sr funds until we deplete all of our allocation of funds then will utilize our sb9 maintenance funds to complete do any of the other maintenance projects we have that will be left what's left from the projects that are ready on the board and and chewed up that we're doing better in progress now okay thank you thank you any other

[00:44:00]
questions I'll move for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 for plumbing services on call Sabina thank you Google yes Danielle Gonzales Barbara Peterson Indiana's the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds to 250,000 dollars this is for data quality software services in Michigan for approval of the purchase of data quality software services this is the procurement method is utilizing a cooperative and it is an estimated purchase of $901,460.65

[00:46:00]
I'll move for approval of the October 2023 cash disbursement all second this is Alsina thank you miss me Yolanda Monterey Cordova yeah give me a letter or Peterson Indiana's investment program for first quarter FY 2024 and missed Mr Turnbull bringing you back to the table here you have the floor for the period of July 1st 2023 through September 30th 2023 information on Market

[00:47:00]
it's sunny overview provides a breakdown of asset class we have 34% in the Invesco money market fund 39% and US Treasury and agency bonds and 27 percent in the local government investment pool the strategy Over Me shows a current particle for the quarter at 6008 million compared to 643 million in the previous quarter cup money market funds are at 3 6 7. 9 5

[00:48:00]
thank you any questions about his presentation if not I'll ask for a motion thank you thank you so our next item for discussion is an update on the fiscal year 2024 budget and do I have 6:30 update on the 2024 and the 20225 budget so I'm going to ask for the next page please so in this presentation we're going to give you an update on the FY 24 operational budget in terms of the timeline and where we're at and what we're doing

[00:49:00]
we're also going to take a look at expenses budget versus actual we're also going to take a look at 20 day enrollment for the current year as of unfortunately continues to decline we're also going to share some historical information around birth rates because that has a large impact on enrollment and therefore on Revenue we're all going to look at an seg Trend a revenue Trend with some projections for 24 and 25 and then we're all going to do an s or update next page please so for the 2424 operational budget update we're here on the upper left in November and we have the gun to prepare financial assumptions for next year next page please thank you

[00:50:00]
on this page the take away is going to be that we have an adjusted budget in expenditures on the operational fund only of 923.6 million we have spent to date 272.9 million which is about 30% we've encumbered another 61% and 564.7% which leaves us with a balance of 86 million or 9% okay the take away for this page on the 20-day enrollment is that we wanted to share that for FY 2220 about 69,000 kids that is an actual number that is not a projected number that is the average of the 80 day and the 120 day from last year unfortunately

[00:51:00]
play a 20-day this year we came in at about 65,000 students which is a reduction of 5.2% and then this will have an unfavorable impact in next year's Revenue just want to give you a heads up there please so they take away on this side is pretty evident right so from 2007 to 2020 birth rates of plummeted dramatically and we also wanted to show on the next page that local birth rate mirrors the national birth rate and if you look at the same time frame right so from 2007 we have about 9 7. 8 8 5

[00:52:00]
2022 we had 6568 that is a dramatic decline it's almost 33% and so again that has unfavorable impact Kinder enrollment that is not just for one year right it continues as those kids go from grade to grade and that will also translate into a revenue decline going forward so on this page we're looking at an enrollment trend from 2013 to 2025 and I think you've seen this graph before but it's different this time is that we're projecting the enrollment for the rest of the year as well as 2025 this is just a first step this is not written in stone this is just what we're looking at today and we will continue to

[00:53:00]
thank you next page please now on this page there's a lot of information but what we're really looking at is a scg revenue Trend so in 22 we were at 719 million as a final funded that's at the bottom in the second column I'm sorry 1233 and then if you look at the very last column we are projecting to be at 880 million in revenue for FY 2525 and again this is just our first stab at it absolutely not permanent we will continue to monitor update as we get more information from the state and as changes continue but bottom line

[00:54:00]
looking at fewer students which means fewer program units and at this point we don't know what the unit value is going to be and it's really really hard to predict what that's going to be so we've left it flat for now but in reality it will probably go up we don't know how much so this is sort of a worst case Revenue number for FY 25 and our last page is an essay with so out of the 242 million dollars that we received we have spent $986 million which leaves us with a balance of 37

[00:55:00]
however meeting with all the Departments all the programs are on track to spend 100% by the time it expires so that's good news that's all I have and I'm happy to answer questions thank you for the presentation so I'm actually going to go down the dice here and see if we have any questions related to tonight's presentation I'll start with board member Peterson thank you and thank you for the report I really appreciate the details and the information it's really helpful and it's really helpful to be able to look back at the unit value over the past few years you know it's clear that it's gone up but that hasn't been necessarily discretionary funds it's been

[00:56:00]
two very specific things which we've needed we've needed the salary increases we've had to stabilize Workforce but somehow I mean the way my brain works I look at the logic of this the state revenues are as higher higher than they have historically been And yet when we see a decline in enrollment instead of being able to say we can serve better and do a better job of meeting the demands of Martinez yassi we can do a better job and this is not at all you're doing I mean it's something that we really need to talk to legislators about we need to take advantage first off to developer Workforce and to make those Pathways so we have more teachers but for the life of me I cannot understand why we don't look at this is an opportunity

[00:57:00]
to actually fundamentally change children's reality in a classroom instead of once again looking at shortage after shortage after shortage and so I I definitely appreciate the work that you're doing to keep us informed to break everything down so it is so accessible and so shareable with the community but I think it really compels us to do a whole lot of work with the legislators yes ma'am thank you thank you board member do you have a question related to the presentation I don't have any questions I keep asking myself how are we how are we going to do this because inevitably a shortage means that we have to cut

[00:58:00]
and like you I mean to put this in deficit mode thinking whereas we should be taking this as an opportunity to you should give us more money and let's do things right for a change because we haven't for I would argue 50 years but the questions I have I don't think you can answer what's going to happen in the classroom is more about what are we as a board going to do to advocate for kids despite the decline thank you I have a question for myself it's essentially what

[00:59:00]
we anticipate in terms of the budgeting process given this information and perhaps this is also but obviously we have the ERS pilot and there's the process of mid-year Department reviews and so how what what might be anticipate in terms of you know the next couple of months budget presentations and to be able to foresee how your team is going to be anticipating in responding to this data well thank you so much for the question of what member I don't know you're correct we're working with the IRS on streaming and there's two parts to it one of them is the how much and the other one is the how well so we will be bringing presentations

[01:00:00]
I hear the decline enrollment obviously it sounds like it's way up at the front end I'm assuming that with kindergartners but have we seen or have we done analysis in terms of where else that decline is a cross the district so that we know where we have to adjust right so if we don't have kindergarteners coming in that's going to impact the I guess just where we are going or how we're going with Elementary but what does it mean for the other programs down the down the road or I guess just the other grades have we done a root cause I mean just an analysis of just where those yes we've spent some time looking at enrollment Trends and Dr Bowman feel free to leave up and correctly up track your it's nothing you haven't heard before the birth rate obviously impacts the

[01:01:00]
but we also see declines in the middle school because people come through Elementary and then they seem to go somewhere for middle school and often times come back they go to a smaller private school for those three years for whatever reason Middle School is what we all know it's an incredibly difficult time of life and a lot of families are trying to find a way to make it easier on their kids somehow now I'm going to be on it I have yet to talk to any Middle School whether it be private public charter whatever you want to call it these middle school kids just all get along and nobody picks on anybody and you know it's it's middle school but there are families tonight

[01:02:00]
got it or I hope that the board thinks about it in you know is there sections of town is there places where maybe we do need to think about that design and delivery a little bit different right I mean we've pushed into some K-8 spaces and places where it does make sense but sort of looking at that approach to specially in smaller Villages smaller communities so that we can continue to keep them you know in a space that you know that will come and I'm not going to make that suggestion because I'm not making a suggestion but I'm just wondering if we're looking at it from those kinds of perspectives as well because we are losing enrollment and we do hear about that Middle School piece where it is kind of falling apart and I'm hoping that you know as we're looking at the budget as a board member Gonzalez is talking about as well as like those presentations to us in terms of where and how potentially the budget

[01:03:00]
and it's not just about you know however we do it or just marketing to get kids back into our district I mean we have to we have to also figure out the students that we do have and making sure that the types of services that were putting together in a package that it's making sense for what we have now too so that we don't lose any more but that we also end up with a quality education for that and you know sort of rethinking of how we purpose ourselves around that because that's the part that I am concerned about is you know just continuously looking for that number and then when to lean pieces and it not being a quality educational site in some of our places but really hoping that in the budgeting piece that we start to look at how we're

[01:04:00]
and thinking about that you know maybe even just trying some things differently so that we could see if we could stop that leakage at Middle School create more confidence there because I do worry about middle schools that get so small to the don't have enough services to really make it a quality educational experience and so I'm also with you board member Peterson in terms of the amount of advocacy that's going to be needed we do have you know the SEC is just one piece of this pie and it's like trying to make sure that all the other pieces that we put in place so that the it's at the end of the day it's the quality of the education that we can deliver with what we have before us which you know is a good amount of money I mean I will say that it's a great amount of money right now and I'm hoping that they will keep that amount of money so that we're thinking about the quality and

[01:05:00]
the impact that we can have with what we can deliver for students and hopefully have great outcomes as a result of that but thank you for the presentation is he did a really good job of describing some of the things and you're absolutely correct on that trend on the on the birth rate so I can see how that's definitely impacting a lot of things it's not just impacting education it's also impacting Workforce because we also are we just don't have a lot of young families either so that's part of our issues and our state so thank you so much thank you for remember Jackson yes so my question is and it's derives from my board member the on the 9% operational balance that were at 9% of budget is remaining and I heard you say oh that's great why why is that great oh okay

[01:06:00]
I'm just curious 9% is good okay and the reason that it's good is that it covers are 4 1/2 million dollars

[01:07:00]
can we do something right for once we can always use this money to build cash for future uses so we can use it to soften the eclipse and we can also I'm going back to the student-based budgeting we can set aside funds to hold sorry to hold some schools harmless for a year 2 years if they're going to have to lower their budgets and then you know they're not going let's say we have to cut a school budget by a million it's not you know we're not cut him off at the knee you know maybe we do it in two years so that's why it's good it's even more along those lines because I always forget halfway through what it's

[01:08:00]
and we save a lot of money in terms of capital projects it's a significant saving to oftentimes behind in their reimbursements to us I believe it 1.5% of $127 million dollars in reimbursements we have just enough that we can make two payrolls so if we don't have when you're down 127.005%

[01:09:00]
exactly what I just told you because the state cannot reimburse an improper rate plus a lot of the smaller districts have really important projects they're building toward because they can't do the capital projects like we do with Mill levies and bonds so they have to save their money to build a roof it's a very different matter what they look at us and they say it's huge and we're saying right now I think about 5% right 6% of the up to 10% so we have our 10% it just helps us a lot of ways it allows for that discretionary spending an emergency situation that's just really good for schools because we can kind of come in and save them out of some really awkward situations it's good because it's 9% it would be great if it was at 10% is that like yeah

[01:10:00]
I think 10% said it again the budget people will give you their answer right I'm the educator all right I like to spend money they like to save money they'd like to have more back there I'd like to spend more but that's just to give him pull that we have between operations and finance that's their jobs to make sure I don't go crazy and spend all the cash reserves because I try to sometimes and they have to fight with me a little bit but yeah more would be better but 9% that's one of the higher numbers I've heard in a while actually so I think we're in pretty good shape I think these guys have done a good job period I actually I am not freaking out about lower revenues I mean we've we've been here before right I mean probably 10 years

[01:11:00]
20 years ago we had a lot more students and I can look at the budget a lower budget and quite frankly more money is not equating to better outcomes so I think what this is really going to force us to do you know with the IRS and and the look that the two questions that you're now going to be forced to ask and we're going to be forced to face we really do to board member Peterson's comment like yes what is going to make the most impact in our kids classrooms and so I don't think the answer is not we don't need more money we have Lenny of money we just need to be very targeted and specific with how that money is being spent I know we're doing you the program review is is ongoing I I hope we're still in that of what programs we need and which ones we don't but I don't

[01:12:00]
I think this is a dire situation this is we need to you know really be specific and direct with how the money is spent and I think errs is going to help us with that and student-based budgeting is going to force us to focus on our outcomes I'm thrilled to know that I mean I just sat through the what was what's the address I just did a genomics I mean there are districts out there that are about to face a fiscal cliff so I'm thrilled to know that we are not about to go off that Cliff so kudos to you for you know looking forward at and and protecting our our funding and protecting how that's going to affect our students the last thing that I'll say is you know we all read in the paper that

[01:13:00]
DD they're going to start looking at accountability right I don't know that more money is going to be coming from from ped from the state they want to accountability for the money that they've been giving us so let's use it wisely let's you know Focus student-based budgeting I'm happy that we're in the position that we're in now where we have sosg we have student based budgeting I mean I think I think we're going to be fine and I think we're in a really good situation with our governance structure so that's it and I'm sorry it is true that ped is provided more money in the state legislature is provided more money really need to remind you that e r s told you the exact same thing we told you that they are taking the money that they're sending us and allocating it so there is no flexibility in the additional

[01:14:00]
the majority of it has gone to salary which honestly we needed to pay the teachers we were dying regionally against Arizona Colorado and they still pay more but at least we are now competitive so our kids the very few kids that go through the College of Education don't just automatically Run for the Border they feel like okay I can live here and make a decent living and starting at $50,000 so almost of 100,000 new money we spent we showed you the chart that 94 of it was gone and it really left us not a lot of flexibility so where is I agree we have been giving more money if the only solution that the state is offering that's not going to change anything it helps if you don't have teachers we can't do anything right but there has to be on it has to do what do we do to change the actions in the classroom and that's got to be an investment in your professional lead

[01:15:00]
and it's got to be investment in the type of PD and then make and it's not just the districts I'm tired of the districts having to make up but higher ed is dropping there's got to be some changes at higher ed where they pick up some of the training that we have to do I mean the reality is we are going to reduce and I agree with board member right-sizing won't do it but it is going to have to be a part of it because if you're going to reduce then you have to reduce your schools you have to reduce your people you have to reduce your programs either the numbers of them or the entirety of it you know whether you make it smaller or just get rid of it so yes I think ERS will come in and say you could consider using these areas but I'm going to tell you there's going to be we're going to hit a point where we're going to have to make pretty tough decisions about programs and people and those are very difficult especially for people in an elected

[01:16:00]
so yes we have more money but I am tired of the LFC and some vegetables tell me we gave you so much like yeah but you didn't let me do anything with it you know let us have some money that we can do something money we've got like you look at the cool things you see out in the schools those kids are out there and they're they're dancing and they're doing stem and they're doing math and creative ways fantastic but I can't replicate that everywhere cuz nine times out of 10 it's a grant because I don't have the money out of the state to do it so that's my only concern with with with with the idea that the pets going to hold us accountable and I look forward with the definition of that means thank you so I I know because you all have talked about the Esther cliff and romance so I know you were prepared for this this

[01:17:00]
this is not coming as a shock to anyone perhaps a shock is how the declining enrollment went down so much and I think that when I first got on the board and you know got elected in February of 2015 and we had about 86,000 students and now we're done in less than 9 years were down like 20,000 students now I don't think that we anticipated it would be like that I just remember the CFO back then saying oh yeah we're going to anticipate losing five or six hundred students and then it kind of went up and then it went to like you know I think 1200 and we stayed there for a while and didn't ever anticipate that this would happen so I think this is just more than what we thought and rightsizing to you can't you know that's not going to solve all the problems either but it's obviously going to be have to

[01:18:00]
we know the kids you know I'm looking at these live births and kindergarten enrollments the kids like you know aren't being born and we can't just depend on that changing like we can't so that's why we have to be we do we have to be prepared because we can go we're going to all the sudden go from you know 6500 back to 9700 and 2007 we know that's likely not going to happen so I'm looking at this and I'm looking back in 2007 and we had 7796 APS kindergarteners and the number of live births were 9788 and then I'll just give some other numbers in 2010 it was 66 and the library was 86 and we have 58 and

[01:19:00]
14 and 8000 live births and then we have in 2017 4776 and live births was 7,436 it's pretty much been about the difference between our enrollment and the live births for kindergarten enrollment is not really different it's a couple of thousand kids every time so that did we ever like look at that cuz that's like something that I know this like wow it's always like this it's like always within a couple of thousand so those couple of thousand children that aren't enrolled in apa then they're enrolled somewhere else so if we expect this to kind of continue how did you or did you all use that information in any of the planning when you were kind of looking at that

[01:20:00]
and this is how many enrolled in APS and it basically stayed the same that there was $2,000 that didn't come to APS that kept on happening and maybe there's there's Dr Bowman so he'll be able to you know how did you how do you how do you use that doctor Bowman so thank you for the question of capturing the key point of what this is telling us what is that there is a very strong correlation between the number of first and then our kindergarten class 5 years later and the difference between those is so so we don't know who who those kids are or where they are but you can think of it as what to what extent

[01:21:00]
those kids were born go to school elsewhere so maybe perhaps this is the rough number of kindergarten seats available in private and parochial schools or homeschool or other methods and it looks like according to this graph it looks like those numbers are staying fairly constant there are of course other reasons why a a child might be born and then you know not show up in kindergarten but the bulk of it is where you're at and you're like it's not really changing things I would be looking for for that number to change is schools that serve kindergarten clothing new stories about schools closing that like private schools are parochial schools closing other schools I haven't seen a number of those stories and so you can just kind of say like that number is the same and the public schools

[01:22:00]
APS particularly are seeing the the decline from the birth rate and in terms of planning I'm kind of as you pointed out you can't get from 90,000 students to 60,000 students in one year and you can't go back the other way around because students are with us for 13 years and so this decline is kind of already baked in with the exception of having a substantial change in the number of students or parents with school-age children who immigrated into the state or or exit so that's how you have students know they're born or they move in or they move out and you can look at the census numbers New Mexico has been fairly stable with respect to move in and move out is on a percentage basis and so what we have is our natural

[01:23:00]
and that's kind of the planet it is if you look out more years you can kind of see what our enrollment is now what's really good and I think Miss Hicks and and I have mentioned is that our funding comes from the state and we get funded you know the year later so this entire declining enrollment time our budget is a little bit nicer than if our enrollment was flat because refunded on this many kids and then we have fewer and then we're funded on this mini and then we have fewer and that is that that's going to continue as long as we're enrollment is dropping I think our challenges are going to be you know if our enrollment increases or if it even stays the same then we'll have a substantial impact on our operational fairly quickly and

[01:24:00]
and I don't know Dr Bowman if you know this I know you like all this stuff but when you're looking at like 20,000 less students than there were eight nine years ago and you figure out with any algorithm what maybe the next 8 years might look like do you think that it will end up stabilizing or it'll pretty much stay so declining so obviously I don't know however we don't have to predict the future to know what those numbers are going to be because the students that are going to be in kindergarten years from now have already been born so we're okay there it's graph I don't know if this is a particular one that yes it does so we know there was a very tiny uptick in life person in 2022 so 5 years from now we should see a little bit of an uptick there but

[01:25:00]
that's 5 years from now so for the next 5 years the incoming Kinder classes are going to be dropping a little bit and then we also know because those students are already with us that we already have this this whole slope of drops and so our enrollment is going to still be client over the next 8 years thank you thank you thank you for the presentation I've always appreciate the depth that you guys go into explaining this so it was helpful thank you so our next item is I'm going to give you a brief report on what we've been working on as a whole with the ad hoc budget committee so we have one meeting left that we are going to wrap it up and some of the changes that you are going to see and you already saw for tonight for example I don't know if you caught on was some of the summaries

[01:26:00]
particular I'll point out on 4.7 we had the the equipment the summary of equipment to be taken out of service so what's great about this is we're really going to try to streamline a lot of our reports and make it more user-friendly so to say especially as we're going to be on boarding some new members and even for the community to really be able to dive in and understand these budget reports because they're they're intense there's a lot of info and for someone who doesn't come from the finance World it can easily go over our heads and we can get lost in the weeds and some of the details and still not understand what's going to happen so what I loved is Miss upper back is really working with her team to make a lot of these reports just easier to understand summarizing them we will still have all the detail documents attached with it those will never leave so if you want to take a deeper dive you are more

[01:27:00]
listen to welcome to but overall she's going to make it easier for us to know what these documents and tail so you're going to see that go into effect you'll see the ability to still put some things on consent we will still make sure that we are following everything when it comes to Legal what we need to discuss what we don't and keep in mind as we move forward for the whole as the budget committee we're trying to be just more effective and more efficient with our time as a whole and how deep we get into these and still remembering that all board members will still have the opportunity to fully participate in any committee be able to give as much feedback as possible and again you're still going to have access to all the supporting documents I don't want to you know fail to stress that because I don't want anyone to feel like we're trying to hide information or we're not trying to be completely open and transparent if anything we're trying to do more of that

[01:28:00]
simplifying the documents and making sure they're easy to read cuz I think that has been our biggest challenge you know even just in mind the last couple of years is our our financial statements are very different than what we would see from a regular business and how do we dive into that to make it easy for everyone from Every constituent every family member anybody within our community to understand what we're doing so I think you for what you're looking for looking ahead to and what we're trying to plan on what to come and I just love the forward thinking that you're always trying to just again be more Innovative even with our own reports and we don't get lost in the details with that so thank you I want to ask board member Gonzalez and also presidential part of the ad hoc committee as well so anything you want to add or mention that I may have missed the only thing is just all of this is aligned with the policy that we passed so the policy indicated what we're

[01:29:00]
what's needed to review in terms of finance and budget in order to make decisions that we need to make and so it'll take a little bit of time to fully aligned all of the reporting to that new policy but that's the framework overall that's guiding all of these decisions thank you know I don't have anything else to add I thought it was great discussions that we had in terms of really looking at it from that perspective I think the only thing I pressed when I was part of that was to the committee or to the staff is like try to think about how it appears to us as board members not being financed experts and not looking at it from that perspective and then also needing to communicate it out or share it with constituents that they had questions so I thought miss papa and her team were very responsive as we were listening to that and some of the thoughts and ideas so it was great exchange thank you right and you're going to see again more of the summer reports throughout the

[01:30:00]
presentation even with the cash disbursements they're going to separate those into categories so versus looking at a multi multi-page document and trying to figure out what vendor is who and why and you trying to make sense of it they're going to separate that so it's a lot clearer for us to understand going forward so that's my report on that and with that being said our next finance committee meeting will be December 18th at 5 p.m. here in the Allison's educational complex at 6400 Uptown and this meeting is adjourned followed by a special morning because we're going to just do our special agenda here so I'm going to welcome the special Board of special board meeting like to call this meeting to order can I have a roll call please please period

[01:31:00]
Surfers item is considered approval of the November 29th 2023 special Board of Education meeting agenda it's just a reminder that if they want to discuss a consent item further or it didn't pass they can take it off the consent calendar when they prove the agenda I moved to prove the November 29th 2023 special Board of Education meeting agenda all second this is Danielle Gonzales our next item is consideration action approval of the consent agenda these are consent items 3.1 through 3.14

[01:32:00]
next Board of Education meeting will be December 6th 2023 at 5 p.m. and the special Board of Education meeting will be on December 13th 2023 at 10:00 a.m. and the meetings will be held here in the Allison Bruce King educational complex and with that we are adjourned thank you
