[00:00:00]
welcome to the Board of Education policy committee meeting I would like to call the meeting to order Miss King may I have a roll call please you love them until I go to the here and give me another Erica here Barbara Peterson here this will help you Romero Dominguez here and Neil Gonzalez here our next item on the agenda is agenda adoption so can I please have a motion for approval of the October 16th policy committee meeting agenda I moved to approve the October 16th 2023 policy committee meeting again can we roll call vote please Barbara Peterson yes yes yes yes yes our next item is approval of the minutes from the policy committee meeting

[00:01:00]
September 18th 2023 can I have a motion for approval of the minutes from the policy committee meeting on September 18th 2023 I'll second that Josefina thank you we have a motion a second yes Barbara Peterson yes yes yes yes yes yes our next item and our first item for discussion is a first read of our budget policy as our presenters today we have our Chief Financial Officer and Jessica Martinez our policy analyst you have before thank you madam chair good evening members of the board and superintendent Elder we have 14 items on tonight's agenda and we are starting with APS budget policy first read on page 12 of your package you will find the budget policy at the request of the policy committee the Chief Financial Officer worked with staff

[00:02:00]
develop a policy that establishes a framework for developing approving and managing the aps budget the aps policy committee first reviewed the draft of this policy during its September 18th meeting and since then the policy has been updated to incorporate the recommendations of board members as well as our legal counsel this is the first read for this policy should the board of the budget policy at tonight's meeting the policy will be posted to the aps website for public input and we'll come back for the board at the November 6th meeting with that Chief Financial Officer Annette is here to respond to your questions thank you for that overview and I will open it up to questions from the word so Madam chair so the questions that that I had were some of those were those changes going to be incorporated into

[00:03:00]
do this budget policy and I know you probably can't tell which ones are mine or somebody else's but yes I know there was some some changes as far as like grammar correct and some missing words and such is that what you were referring to let me see if I can find like find know which ones were mine period so there was a question around we've had to approve emergency expenditures in the past but we no longer have to what changed and so there's a clear answer to that the next one is suggesting a change on budgeting approach page 2 which the person suggests is heavy on Words and make some suggestions to edits and questions what is school types mean so there's an answer to hear to school types and

[00:04:00]
maybe we want to talk through other ways to make budgeting approach tighter okay that was one of yours so we're going through yeah I'm at it now so so the first one the first one about approved by the board that just changed because legal thought that that change was an important one to make correct that's correct okay because they said something and then on the on the one that I'm sure just read is school types was addressed but I think talking about like those with the greatest learning needs are we just leaving at generalized like that because we don't have any idea what the greatest learning needs are because learning needs for some are very different than for others so for some it could be you know

[00:05:00]
is that the best thing to do is leave it open like that we were thinking that the greatest learning needs would be like the Martinez students and e l l specialist so that's the group's we were looking at okay so I mean that would be concerned me because there's all kinds of learning needs and I just know from having taught that those kids that are you know twice exceptional or extremely gifted if they don't have if their needs are met those kids have a really high incidence of dropping out of school because they're not challenged so it isn't those kids that just have certain learning needs that encompasses you know in my opinion having been a teacher it comes as more than just who you just mentioned thank you for that so I do think

[00:06:00]
across individual schools and school types for the purpose of being policy is sufficient and I don't think it's the role of policy to get into the details that would be administrative procedural directive and would vary by year by year based on outcomes and monitoring and I think to the point around students with exceptional needs and whether they drop out of high school that would fall under goal three presentations so I don't know that we need to make I guess my perspective is that I don't know that we would need to make a change in the policy rather than the administration would determine and the procedure directive does that make sense that the way that the policy should be this high level Communication in terms of the vision of this right that student needs across individual schools and school types and supports I mean I think that's

[00:07:00]
I think it's also broad enough so that an individual school is going to look at at their budget and I think what I like about the policy is that we're acknowledging that that flexibility is also at the school level too so that but it also goes without saying that they better have good justifications in terms of how they're doing it and that they're all so putting it when there's flexibility that they're funding towards student needs and not just these sort of broad categories right I mean it is about meeting student needs so I I like the way that it stated because I think it gives that kind of flexibility that we really want to see for that site management site leadership and I just want to make sure that it doesn't just include what you know Papa said that it really is dealing at the school level with the need to act their school I mean like

[00:08:00]
last week or the week before I was at a school in my district that's going to become a community school and they don't they their needs are very different than what you would typically say a community school needs they're not going to need a food pantry or clothing make their needs are going to be completely different because of where that school is situated so learning needs are also going to be based on the needs of the school but there will be some that won't have the needs that you mentioned so I mean I think if we do leave it with that with a greatest learning needs that could Encompass more than what you just suggested are the next comment was related to the finance committee on finance committee on page three oh check this quick question because I know I apologize I was running late can you tell me what was the date that the Q&A came in I'm trying to pull up that document do you have it October 13th at 8:39 a.m. thank you

[00:09:00]
I was just trying to find it on my and I'm like not having any luck thank you yeah no problem so there was some question about the finance committee and I think that one period that was mine and it did get answered but I'm really not satisfied with the answer and I think it wants more discussion of by Statute by our role is board members one of our major responsibilities and I truly appreciate the work that we've done to streamline that that there's a lot that's really and truly just administrative but I continue to be really

[00:10:00]
concerned about how having a two-person or three person committee is going to give all board members access to the same depth of conversation and discussion and I feel like it I mean we talk all the time about how we invest our money is the statement is very values and I really and truly do not see how we can fulfill that obligation without making sure that the entire board has access to the same amount of questioning discussion and oversight thank you so I read the board president will appoint a finance committee as required by law to assist the board in carrying out its budget and finance duties the committee may also review financial statements monitor revenues and expenses provide over

[00:11:00]
monitoring committee on budget and other financial matters so that's why currently read so the language around two members was taken off so it is really open to whether it's 23456 or 7:00 for the board to decide I think you raise an important Point around transparency and how do we ensure that everyone has access to the same type of information and this is something that has come up in the ad hoc meeting on finance which is shared by member marrow but miss apple.com I think part of that that question that you put on the table number Peterson is what we've been discussing and so the other members of the committee can help refresh my memory but I think the sort of consensus was is that nothing changes in terms of what the board gets the board still gets all of the financial materials that are required by law and by the

[00:12:00]
PS3 the big binder so we still receive all of that and then a committee of a number of people is determined by the president does all of the discussion and the review and and so members could still submit questions could still engage but the meeting the committee is a committee of folks that have specific responsibility and then things that the Board needs to vote on do you come to the board for consent after being reviewed in that committee so it's more about streamlining timing and efficiency and having all of the transparency and information stay the same and I'm getting ahead of member who committee this is who is going to report it who is in here so that's the only reason that I'm getting ahead but did I get any of the wrong or no and I think remember Peterson where and I'm just going to

[00:13:00]
I'm going to use a personal experience right now because I'm sitting in for a board member Tapia Romero on finance this week because she's out of town and so I had an opportunity to meet with the finance team to get prepared for the meeting and what I realized in that conversation is a lot of it was procedural in terms of like sort of understanding some documents understanding some processes and being able to give feedback that way and I think that's what a finance committee would be able to do is sort of like discern that kind of stuff and give feedback but it doesn't negate that we wouldn't get the depth of information it's really more around procedural pieces of like how to present information or sort of making and making recommendations to the board again I think that it's always going to be bored president and it's going to be bored decision to I think the board president is going to take that into

[00:14:00]
what's the pleasure of the board in terms of how that functions I know for us it's always been a board of the hole but there is an opportunity there what I realized is that board member type of Romero as the chair just by herself is engaged in that conversation but it doesn't necessarily mean that there's been a committee to make those kind of recommendations back I know that the meeting that I have with Miss Apodaca this week in the team was really helpful I was like wow I understand now where some of that it's kind of the planning stage or that conversational stage around how to present information and how to prepare information and how to make recommendations on what would be useful to the board we haven't had that conversation and that's the place where it's going to happen it's not necessarily going to happen just in a finance meeting by itself it could but it's not it's not it because we're undertaking the documents itself so I think

[00:15:00]
sort of the nitty-gritty of just that the conversation about finances a whole I'm glad that the language is taken out about just two members I didn't I didn't agree with that as well but I think it just leaves it open and right now as we're sitting with this particular board we're still aboard the whole so I think there's a difference between being able to get information and I think the format that we are using for questions ahead of time his been beneficial to everyone involved and it has helped streamline but nevertheless that is different from being able to engage in discussion and I think that we do have a real obligation

[00:16:00]
with our with our responsibilities as board members to be able to participate in that I mean to a certain extent that it seems like this description is somewhat like the preparation we used to do as committee chairs with staff people to go over and talk about what would be on the agenda streamline and make sure that we could address any questions ahead of time or you know serve predict where the discussion would go to and what kinds of information would be necessary and so if it's if it's really and truly limited to that kind of role and the in other formats the agenda the items would be really and truly open for discussion then I think it would have a role but if it's

[00:17:00]
what's the ability of board members to have the same depth of discussion understanding knowledge and voting I do continue to have an issue with it and I'm hearing you suggested an opportunity to engage in discussion and the policy should not plan to the ability of all board members to engage so given that the entire rest of the policy is about the board role in budgeting and Finance in the documents they receive the financial reports through receive the budgeting process what language would you add to this policy to make it such that addresses your concerns around ability to engage in discussion and not supplying that for all board members to me if it would simply be that the board acts as finance committee

[00:18:00]
and that the appointment of particular board members would be left out that it could say something along the lines of having a chair as we do now that gets voted on by the board as a whole to streamline or to to discuss the agendas and such but I think it goes back to having full access for the entire board to these discussions I mean otherwise in this sort of gets into one of the later portions in our government's part I think we could be prepared for many items being taken off of consent and that if we don't have access to full discussion ahead of time I think consent items will be

[00:19:00]
much more challenged as consent because we'd be accepting consent when we haven't had full discussion so I guess I'm trying to clarify where it says that the full board doesn't have access to the information or doesn't have ability to engage in discussion because if there is that we can address that so I mean I think it's it's assumed if it reads that the board president will appoint a finance committee is required by law to assist the board and carrying out its special it leaves open to me or unstated and unclear how the board can go go about carrying out its budget and finance duties without having access to that initial

[00:20:00]
and discussion and this is despite the rest of the policy that indicates all of the financial reports that we receive and the process and everything else but again I think that having access to the information is different from having access to the discussion so remember Peterson you're talking about we are not really being able to way it's written it's not guaranteeing that we are going to be able to deliberate right right and I mean I think that the result of that would be anytime there is a question that I can foresee board meetings becoming less efficient rather than more efficient if there are many issues that are taking off of consent for further discussion

[00:21:00]
because I don't see that but we could talk through what it looks like because part of it is there's a lot of stuff on finance committee agendas that nobody wants to talk about that we don't need to talk about that it's a proving past expenses that it's improving transfers where there are things that people do want to talk about or there is a lot of questions the practice has been that that comes off of the finance agenda and goes or comes off of consent and goes to a full discussion or goes to a board meeting I think some of the examples around like materials adoption when really it's a financial it's a finance option it's a finance agenda item and we are approving the expenditure but because there are so many questions the board president has made it a separate agenda on a separate board meeting and so I think that's the idea is that if something shows up on a finance committee agenda and you have a lot of questions on it and you would want to be a part of a conversation then you would contact the committee chair and either your joining that committee meeting or you're already

[00:22:00]
but I think that's what this ad hoc committee has discussed there's always an opportunity for people to engage and we use our judgment on when it's all seven engaging versus 234 or whatever the committee becomes but I don't know what are the examples of things that are going to slip through that warrant discussion that aren't going to get the discussion or the numerous things that are going to be pulled off consent after they've already been addressed so I think that the process that we've been using of having way more items on consent I mean we really and truly do not need to separately approve the interruption transfers and the cash disbursement and I think that moving those on to consent so any

[00:23:00]
absolutely that has been a great improvement in our agendas by doing that but I and I think the curriculum adoption is the perfect example of something that because of how closely it aligns with goals and card frailes I think without a doubt even though it is clearly within the realm of the administration in the superintendent for making that call I think that it behooves us as a board to have their discussion of it so that we really understand so that we understand the process and what the decision is so how it gets stated I mean in practice in

[00:24:00]
I'm not sure that this is a huge step forward from what our new policy is or any procedure is and I think it I think it needs to be more strongly stated then if we leave it as a finance committee that is separate from the board as a whole that they're really be clarification of what would come to the discussion with the board is a hole can you help me so sometimes it's I work better with like a scenario right because I can get so so bored member Peterson help me a little bit here too so let's say scenario we have three members on this committee and they go into the committee and they're talking about next week's

[00:25:00]
taking care of like what is it that we're going and make recommendations basically to the board the board of a hole right so let's say that part of that conversation was a curriculum adoption how just kind of walk me through how would that work how would you see it so I think that the way it has worked in the past right is that so it's a paradise it was a approval for the IT department to be able to purchase period he would have asked those questions but if they were still more questions I think

[00:26:00]
and what the policy committee document says is it's the discretion of the policy chair in the president so I think in this version we can add a sentence that says it's at the discretion of the finance chair and the president if something needs to be pulled off and moved to a full board agenda can I pop in here cuz I think I have this this is how I'm distinguishing it if it's okay you don't mind 100% go ahead so I think where we're getting caught at is the way I'm just wishing it is that there are budget issues and then there are finances and I know this is like very simple or in my mind the budget is our is our responsibility as a whole it's our statutory obligation to review budget items curriculum is a budget item like big items that we have an obligation as a whole to discuss the way I'm envisioning

[00:27:00]
finance committee subcommittee is it's it's the procedural stuff it's the nitty-gritty it's the reviewing of the inter and the intra Grant transfers it's it's the stuff that doesn't affect our government's role it's a management role but because we have an obligation to oversee by appointing a subcommittee to review that at the first level not at the not at the top level but just at the first level that not only creates efficiency and efficiency structure but it it allows it allows us to work within the larger context of our budget issues we can all remember the very first day we start

[00:28:00]
January of 2022 asking intra and Inter function questions because we didn't understand what they were right and it took forever if we have a committee that can review those and give recommendations that saves us a lot of time so to your to your needing a scenario in my estimation that finance committee would look at the packet as a whole and would say you know this is curriculum this needs to be pulled out this is Interruption we can throw that on to consent it's like we're giving our trust to that small committee to kind of make those early decisions that then come all combined come to the community the board as a whole so this is the first street and we're trying to get it to better here's what I'm proposing so in this section on finance

[00:29:00]
I think we can add language that the committee is open to all members all members can join the committee meetings are posted publicly and all finance committee materials are posted publicly and I didn't want something else when I'm writing this here but something like the board and finance board chair board president finance committee chair will determine if any particular finance committee item warrants movement to full board meeting or something like that so if we add those three Provisions to the finance committee portion of this before we bring it back for a full read are we making progress towards addressing the concerns that are on the table and Jose I know you wanted to get in number so I remember doing it well I was just having more questions when when I hear is getting into the management side of things

[00:30:00]
sometimes will be a question of why was there a transfer and then they'll go get the answer and give it back to us rather that question why was there a transfer being handled at a group table of 7 it's happening in the group conversation of 2345 or 6 or whatever but not managing and so I think it's wise to add that the committee is open to all members and what was the other that the president and the chair will there were three posted publicly all materials are posted publicly and something around the world so if all items are posted publicly and all members have it's still open

[00:31:00]
I want to use board conversation time issues that were responsible for and not on these little nitty-gritty things that I think can be time-consuming they're important but I think as a board member it's my responsibility if it's publicly posted and it's all out there then it is my responsibility is a board member to call something out if I have concerns with it but we

[00:32:00]
also still have the opportunity to call it out in a board meeting because it could so if so for example me is board president if any one of the board members came to me and said you know I'm really not comfortable with this particular item I know it was seen by the finance committee but I really want to lift that I want that to be on the agenda I would lift it I I mean I guess I understand the need for efficiency on this because because of the link of like everything that we have but I also understand your concern board member Peterson because it is in my ear I'm listening to the person over at nmsba who just really hammered on us the importance of budget and the significant responsibility that we have around budget because what I

[00:33:00]
and I keep hearing it from our Auditors to the Auditors don't find fraud the Auditors don't find that stuff those are going to be seen by either us as board members because we're asking really hard questions or buy a really a student CFO like renette who's the same this doesn't look good we've got some issues or our superintendent who will find it as well and that's the conversation we need to be having at a board level because it's not really the audit that's going to help us get there so I so that's ringing in my ear a little bit and I know that you know I'm not going to be here starting in January I believe as a board member I would be really concerned especially as a new board member coming in wanting to know Finance like that's the hardest one I think it's the hardest piece that we do but I like the proposed language they include everybody it's open

[00:34:00]
everybody and that everything's publicly posted and you still have you know the opportunity to to answer questions and to pull things off so I mean I understand that part that makes sense to me I'm still I'm still struggling a little bit with process but I agree with you first read kind of I kind of have to stealing your term I have to Noodle on it a little bit because I'm not I'm not quite sure why I'm not comfortable 100% I think I just need to think it through a little bit and so don't have a report out from the ad hoc Finance yeah yeah which has had all of these conversations and submitted questions for legal and so that's sort of still apparel process and so I think it may change further are based on the final review or final recommendation of that ad hoc committee but I guess for now as we're thinking about potential changes is this good enough or is there more

[00:35:00]
it is a

[00:36:00]
bring me to not have to vote on every single separate item of a finance committee meeting agenda it is a total waste of time in the question format has been really helpful but I still think we have to guarantee access to full discussion when it's warranted okay so we'll we'll do something on that continue to move through the Q&A document we've sort of started to get into some of all of the subsequent questions which were related to what is on a consent agenda and why and some of those things so I'm not going to go question mark here but we'll sort of more generally open it up again are there any other specific edits that you have assuming that the word stop is going to make the specific suggested here particularly as it relates to grammar

[00:37:00]
any other things that you want to pull out for discussion or potential amendments to the policy given that this is 1st Street we're going to be discussing here in a few minutes board meeting materials lays out the entire process of how the entire board will always get all of the information so I realize we're going back to what we just discussed but we have an entire policy right here the talks about how everybody has access to all of the information and how exactly that is going to happen so I'm hoping that that alleviates some of the concerns of information not being given to the whole board

[00:38:00]
let the public have a chance for public review can you sort of walk through that timeline one more time we'll have a chance for public review its 30 days or until the next board meeting so we'll post starting tomorrow with your recommendations and the next board meeting will be goodness well the next policy meeting will be November 6th so we can bring it again for November 6th for the final reading vote and then if it pat whatever passes then goes to consent on November 15th yeah yes that's okay great thank you all right so we are now on our next item which is adoption of guardrails for the board and our presenter again is Jessica Martinez our policy analyst

[00:39:00]
make Madam chair or next action item is consideration of adoption for the guard rails for the board which can be found on page 17 of your packets as part of its commitment to student outcomes Focus governance the Board of Education will consider the adoption of its own guard rails just as it adopted guardrails for the superintendent the guard rails for the board are actions that board members may not take or allow in pursuit of the district schools and once the committee adopts the guardrails for the board they will be included in the aps Board of Education governance manual and the side is now open for discussion by the board great thank you and so in our document we have the guard rails for the board board real one which we have discussed which is not acting on assumptions and I know there's a question in the Q&A that we can talk through guardrail to has a couple of different options to consider there's three options one option one is the way we initially wrote it and then two or three or some feedback from our associate coach

[00:40:00]
and then Beauregard rail 3 is as we wrote it and then guardrail for we have what we originally wrote which is option one and then there was suggestion to refine it based on our current policy and then again for option 5 we have a couple policies to consider so hopefully folks have had a chance to review the multiple options as well as the guardrails themselves and can weigh in so that we can try to get to good on these as well so starting with word real one board members will not act on assumptions about each other's intentions and will accept responsibility for their own actions and behaviors so the question in the Q&A is how will we not act on assumptions how is this possible and I don't know that it is but we did change it from will not make assumptions about each other's attention to will not act on so I don't know that there is any really way to enforce it but I'm open to we are all open to edits

[00:41:00]
for how to strengthen this one if anyone has any suggestions for guardrail one I mean that was mine but I don't know how to make it you know how to change it otherwise I would have it's just we all have these assumptions that we I think obviously can't help but act on but we can't and so that was part of the discussion was assumed good intentions give Grace and that's what we need to focus on and so we can ask questions of the other board members so we could make this longer but I think that the idea was that we can control our own behaviors and we cannot act on assumptions but I don't know like I don't know that there's a stronger way to word it unless I think it's about acting on those assumptions right you have them but you not acting on those assumptions without a conversation a conversation first

[00:42:00]
I really like discard rail cuz I think it gets to the heart of the matter on what student outcomes Focus governance is about you know do not comes don't change until it don't behaviors change and so this really is talking about our behaviors and I think that it's the expectation as board member Gonzalez is talking about it's really about that intention of having a positive mindset coming in coming in with a mindset that you know my actions are going to impact someone else the way that I speak to the way that I you know Port myself or carry myself has impact to you all as board members but also to our staff and to our classrooms and so I really like this board guard mail I agree with you board member this is not an easy one to measure that's not in

[00:43:00]
but I think it really calls upon us as individuals to really sort of always take stock and use that opportunity to you know to be our best selves and to bring our best selves when we're here or when we're doing any kind of business that's associated with the board it's hard to not have assumptions absolutely it's absolutely hard and I think we have a assumptions about everything in our lives from our family members to people we work with to our communities but I think it's just it's just that intention of a setting that it's a mindset that we have to bring with us as we start this work and as we carry the work forward and so to that end it's not impossible to test assumptions and are an article from MIT Sloan management review on how to test your assumptions which first step is

[00:44:00]
but we can share the article with the full board so we can learn how to test our assumptions unless there are any other specific edits that we might make to the policy I think we agree that we can't control so I wonder if and you actually just said it as you were starting this discussion I wonder if this would help clarify is just adding assume good intentions that board members will assume good intentions will not act on assumptions and will accept responsibility for their own actions and behaviors

[00:45:00]
anything that encourages a conversation with your fellow board member without a conversation there's a negative to clarify all questions motivating decisions that impact more relationships to come on just for some guidance for a way to add assuming good intentions and I would love your guidance on that hi everyone so this is a great conversation and I want to back up just a little bit and say I will I will send the pdf version with the full the full article about untested assumptions and so

[00:46:00]
the way that this what that this Garden Wall was initially written and had the board shall not do this and do that and then do this so adding that additional language of we will make we will act on or no I'm sorry what was what was the language can you say it one more time your intentions assume assume good intentions so the challenge with that is that you can't really you can't really test that you can't really there's no way of knowing whether people are making a good assumptions or not but acting on so not acting on untested assumptions is something that you absolutely can know whether or not is happening and even if it's just inequal it's still something that can be proven

[00:47:00]
it's much harder to prove whether or not someone is acting on best intentions or acting in good faith or making positive assumptions so that's just my coaching the it's really up to the board on whether on what language you ultimately end up with I will remove my amendments I like the way it's written personally but it's clear to me is everyone okay with it and I'd like to see without a conversation that phrase without a conversation to clarify or questions because it's more precise its new board members guidance about that behavior and you read the whole thing for board members will not act on untested assumptions without a conversation to clarify all questions motivating

[00:48:00]
motivating decisions that impact board relations and I think you know we want to clarify all questions that impact board relations and I mean more not discouraged conversation and will not assume bad intentions and will accept responsibility for their own actions and behaviors so you have conversation in there I think I'm just not

[00:49:00]
behaviors the house the details maybe that should be determined because we're adults and trusted with by the public and if there are more serious concerns it's in the governance manual 4G so I already forgot this was a member Miller goings initial question so are you okay with moving

[00:50:00]
had I known exactly what it was what word would have made it like as perfect as it could possibly be I just couldn't I just couldn't find it I think it's a good guard rail I don't want people to act on assumptions about me or about my fellow board members you know that we often have to stick up for each other and say this is not true so I don't think it's I think it's a good guard rail of the guard rails that is probably one of my favorite ones cuz I think it's a good one you know like a conversation is it implies that it's okay to act on assumptions if you have had a conversation

[00:51:00]
if I have an assumption that you are a Russian spy I shouldn't go talk to you about it and have a conversation like I should just do something assume that you're here good intent you're going to do what you committed to do you're going to follow the commitments you made to your community and if some bigger concern arises where I've learned that your filtering information to Putin then I raise it through the governance manual process exactly it's a value statement the card rails are values so I agree with that 100% we're not going to act on assumptions about each other's intentions but I think as it's clearly stated because the governance manual does give us the procedures for when we don't live up to this value I think we like the essence of it we have some concerns with me but the language but I think we're good to go on to number two and maybe those concerns will be alleviated once we get the document the full document

[00:52:00]
meeting time and being more efficient in our board meetings so we at the end of our last policy committee meeting ended up with option one and then our coach refined them with two suggestions so what we had ended with was the board will not spend less than 50% of public meeting time monitoring progress and student outcome goals and guardrails and the rest of its time conducting retired board work delegating the district's Administration to the superintendent so also a little long and clunky and streamlined by her coach with option to the board will not spend less than 50% of public meeting time monitoring students and option three the board will not spending time on matters that fall outside of the definition of Boardwalk which is defined in the photo

[00:53:00]
s o f g governance manual there's a much more robust definition but here in parentheses we have goals guardrails or matters prescribed by law so I will open up this one to discussion around how people are feeling around options 2 and 3 or some combination of 123 period number one is very wordy and it actually pulls in stuff is already discussed in the governance manual so number two is short and sweet it also hits the 50% that we're also attempting I just sat through a Time use tracking training today about the 50% so I think option two is is to the point I saw everyone nodding and Barbara you also are good with two so when we consider this

[00:54:00]
when making important decisions about such matters as the budget superintendent hiring and setting of goals and guardrails and there were no comments or suggestions submitted on this one so we're all good with me so is this is just a question that obviously sometimes things are the only like we're limiting it to just those budget hiring and goals and guard rails I don't think we're limiting I think it's worth saying on these things we will absolutely have Community boys but not at the exclusion of other things it doesn't say that part ok

[00:55:00]
I don't know it's up to you I mean I don't I think it I got it I mean I got that it was it wasn't just about these that's me but will everybody else will everybody else get that it's not just only about these I got it I think so because it's that negative right will not exclude that then forces into the positive of on these we will absolutely include Community voice what would happen if we just stopped at important decisions I think that's where we stopped at home and then we had to have but so we have such matters but we could make it when making important decisions about matters such as but not limited to the budget superintendent hiring and guard girls

[00:56:00]
will have but not limited to in after and before as the matters as the budget for the option that we came up with was no board member will represent through their words or actions the voice of the entire board on members of the community I'm sorry I'm on matters at the board has not publicly adopted there was separately already language in our policy that read the board will not be bound by any statement or action on the part of an individual board member no board member will speak for or represent the entire board unless so authorized by the majority of the board so I think these things are saying the same thing but the I guess we don't want anyway so what do people think about that and in our Q&A

[00:57:00]
there's a suggestion guardrail for could read the board will not be bound by individual board members words or actions not authorized by the board majority so maybe another option there I just made it try to make it shorter try to get everything in there but just see the two in front of you period so yeah I see how you tried to consolidate it but what I kind of like about option number one is that it brings in will not represent or appear to represent whereas so that's that's an action that's being taken by a board member where at so that limits my ability to represent right but the second one is discussing the board is

[00:58:00]
cool will not be bound and so I would rather option one because it kind of limits my ability to go out and say well the whole board wants to Institute ice cream Fridays maybe the whole work doesn't want to Institute ice cream parties so I think I like option one is there other strong opinions question mark policy so I think this question was you don't need to create

[00:59:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:00:00]
where's your own opinion and and through that as the president so I like option one member Jackson likes option one I like option one remember was board members will not be disrespectful of Staff time and resources and will establish a process for tracking the cost of Staff time dedicated to board support our coach offered the coaching of the board as a whole nor individual board members will allow the cost of Staff time dedicated to board support to increase

[01:01:00]
to increase or I don't understand or remain the same Ashley can I call you back on to walk us through your coaching on this one hi again so what this one is so within the updated is to reduce the burden on the amount of time Staffing on governance governance related items then the board will not allow the cost of Staff time to increase or remain the same so that means that you are not continuing to put the same the same cost on staff and that you were

[01:02:00]
so working to reduce the amount of time that the staff is spending on board related items so right now if you were to if you were to calculate all of the time the staff has spent and not just your bored staff but also your budget staff and all of the Departments principles who you know escort you through through through campuses and literally every single staff member who you interact with on a the work that you do as a board that would reduce overtime how do you how do you measure that so we actually have a have a tool so today Gonzalez

[01:03:00]
I'm use instruments that we have we also have an instrument for staff to calculate the use of staff and it's and it is more it is not as precise as the the time you tracker that you use which really gets down to the minute it's more estimating but it's still it can be pretty profound when you lay all those numbers out I mean I like option one but I would take out the cost and then just say tracking staff time dedicated to board support I think cost is trying to put like a money amount on there if you're talking about cost which it may not be because that's part of the evaluation so I think our problem with the suggested that is the it's hard to understand because of the negatives so I think we could take the coaches feedback and figure out a way to make it more easily understand

[01:04:00]
we want to reduce the amount of staff time that's expected so how do we say that in a way that people understand well yeah I mean in the interest of the board is a whole nor individual board members will go I mean the first one time and resources for tracking the cost of stuff time to ensure that

[01:05:00]
report does not increase something like that like stating that to what end of why we're tracking the cost of Staff time because we don't want it to stay the same and we don't want it to increase but we do want to decrease are you just so you're doing option one but then you're adding yeah time dedicated to board support in order to reduce cost of dedicated to board support in order to reduce the burden and cost in order to reduce the burden on cost that will establish a process for tracking the cost of stop time dedicated to board support in order to reduce the burden and cost

[01:06:00]
I think we all know that we want to reduce the burden of cost and so I guess the question is do we want to put that into the guardrail or let the fact that we're going to be tracking It And discussing it in our evaluation be the thing cuz we're holding ourselves accountable for that in the evaluation anyway yeah well so if I mean in that case I think probably option two is the most succinct and disgusted that exact issue but I'm confused all right does anyone else have a suggestion for how to tighten it I mean I'm just like wondering if we and the staff would be able to answer this question is now that we give the questions ahead of time is that really

[01:07:00]
being in the cost of Staff time where there might be questions during a meeting that were answered and we wouldn't have had to ask them ahead of time if they were presented and we did our questions you're like oh I didn't have to answer cuz sometimes that happens and then I'm like oh I wouldn't have had to ask that question if I would just heard the entire presentation so I'm just wondering if this is costing more of the staff's time asking the questions ahead of time I don't know actually it's been tremendously helpful to have the questions at a time when I think the issue here isn't necessarily the ask answering board questions related to board agenda items it's doing everything else that we asked them to do maybe that we need to specify but I think that's what Ashley was saying is in the tracking tool and and remember Jackson has a proposed at it I think I have a proposed it okay board members will not be disrespectful of of Staff time and resources and will

[01:08:00]
English a process for tracking staff time dedicated to board support in order to reduce reduce the burden and cost I heard it yeah is everyone else along with Miss Martinez that we made and then we'll move to getting a motion in a second to accept these guardrails so we like to board real one as is for board guard rail to we like option to for Border Grill three we are going to keep working too right before we like option one

[01:09:00]
1 and 2 so we're keeping the beginning of one will not be respectful with disrespectful of Staff time will establish a process for tracking staff time dedicated to board support so we're cutting the cost of there and then we're adding in order to reduce the burden reduce the burden and cost okay does that sound so I think we need then a motion to accept the guard rails as amended I move to accept the board guard rails as amended wonderful so we have a motion and a second to adopt the guard rails for the board as a roll call please Elana

[01:10:00]
we're going to make progress on that next scoring evaluation router get another point or two all right we're moving on our next item is consideration of approval of the aps Board of Education governance manual yes Madam chair our next item is on page 20 of your packets this item is consideration of approval of the aps Board of Education governance manual the policy committee will continue its work on a board of education governance manual that incorporates board goals guard rails delegation and governance policies the manual has been updated to include board member and legal recommendations on page 41 staff has also included a document provided by cgcs that outlines the status of Ford government's policies in light of the creation of the governance manual I'd also like to make a note of page 42 which is a document outlining board member Communications for consider

[01:11:00]
this language has been provided at the board's request with that the manual is now ready to be considered for approval by the committee if approved by the committee the governance manual will be added to a board meeting consent agenda for final approval and the goal is to have the manual approved by the end of the calendar year great thank you and so is a refresher this board governance spaniel started with the appointment of an ad hoc committee back in March April and so the board that committee which was member Dominguez and member Jackson began to meet late April and May not over the course of the summer the committee reviewed sfg materials they reviewed all of aps's board government's policies which are being policies and our be procedural directives they also looked at other districts governance manuals and they presented their initial draft for us to review in August so we had an opportunity to review the first draft the full board also had opportunity

[01:12:00]
full board meetings in September during those meetings the ad hoc committee also highlighted the biggest areas for discussion which is where we focus our discussion in our last policy committee meeting which was on the conflict of interest so we'll continue to discuss that tonight and go through the changes that were made as a result of the last policy committee meeting and there were suggestions that were made in that meeting there were suggestions that were made after the meeting in writing and then there were suggestions that were made by our legal counsel who was also here tonight to provide answers to any questions and then we're also reviewed by the state ethics commission and given feedback on that so our goal give all of the feedback the time the review the questions and the edits promise Martinez's comments is to approve the entire governance manual today and so I

[01:13:00]
we will turn to member Jackson and member Dominguez who shared the ad hoc committee to give us an overview of the the changes anything that I missed and changes that have happened since the last committee policy committee meeting where we reviewed this so you can review those changes and drawers to the page numbers and what we need to know and as the last process or point us to where we need to be okay what I meant but as per the last process we want to make really clear what we're approving and so our final emotion is going to be to approve the governance manual as amended so we're going to make amendments as we're going and then we're going to prove the full thing as a whole so we're going to sort of continue to track any additional changes that we're making and just for clarification I heard something about it December and then it's going to go on to a board committee I'm sorry to full board

[01:14:00]
what's the executive committee says those agendas so what's whenever it makes sense to get onto one of those agendas is a consent and will be continuing the living document know once it's approved it's it's approved as a final document that would be at the board okay I think that's like at any point we can bring it up for another thing to be our governance manual to guide us going forward I guess I'm asking about if it's living document and we can continue to work towards for clarification not to change policy but it's essentially a policy so we can go forth and make edits in the same way we would add other policies so it would come back to committee it would the policy committee the

[01:15:00]
it's a Word document and you can make changes we all can make changes whenever we want to have to go through like a policy committee it have to be recommended to have to go back all right so as I alluded to before I sat through a Time used Trucking training today and one of the things that was discussed was how to how to track time and it occurred to me that there is something in the governance manual that would need to be updated so if I can first point everyone to 4858 so it would be

[01:16:00]
that's the bottom of page 12 and it discusses sorry the top of page 13 where it says the secretary will keep track of meeting time dedicated to student outcomes Focus governance the direction that we received today is that the secretary manages the process but that each board member takes a turn each month to track the time so in order to align with that I would like to amend 8 to say manage the process of time keeping dedicated to student outcomes Focus governance so the next

[01:17:00]
adjustment that I would like to offer is on okay 4S code of conduct looking the first is looking at some Q&A that came in there was a potential rewrite of that first sentence and you're on page 11 I'm sorry I am on Page code of conduct so a Q&A the confidence and trusted to us as public officials the board commits itself to ethical professional and lawful conduct proper use of authority and appropriate to

[01:18:00]
I would like to offer that as did you read that again sure and it's on page 3 of the Q&A if that helps okay to preserve the confidence entrusted to us as public officials the board commits itself to ethical professional and lawful conduct proper use of authority and appropriate decorum so we're just removing that first sentence for us dot currently it says public office is a trust created by the confidence that the public places in the Integrity dot dot

[01:19:00]
a Q&A came in that said rewrite that to say again what was in the Q&A document so for that entire beginning or just the part that's highlighted in turquoise it's the entire so that the part that's highlighted and turquoise was added after the last policy meeting but the Q&A suggestion is to take that whole thing out and to replace it so I was offering up as a suggestion do you want me to make all of my suggestions and then yeah I think so I think everyone's okay with that one it's really just streamlining a couple of countries

[01:20:00]
okay and then I noticed so again on 4S so going down to number two again that blue highlighted where it says board members will disclose to the board Services office and pure board members all gifts comma regardless of value the first suggestion I have is that actually should be moved to number three because number three is where gifts are discussed and the amendment that I would like to make is to it would say board members will disclose to the board Services office and pure board members all gifts over $250 to align with the New Mexico Gift Act because again in the Q&A

[01:21:00]
mentioned that could be quite difficult we get pens notepads coffee mugs so to put in a specific dollar amount that aligns with New Mexico the New Mexico Gift Act trying to help clarify it if it has that there are a member Jackson is is the 200 because I didn't read the New Mexico Gift Act is the 200.00 listed in there and then you Mexico gift at least in the New Mexico so if we if it's says in the third one if it already says board members will adhere to the provisions of the New Mexico Gift Act then I think that's suffice is I think so it doesn't it doesn't so we're we are required to adhere to it but the limitation on gifts that mentions a state officer or employee or a candidate for State office or the person's family so

[01:22:00]
so we're basically taking the definition of a gift from The Gift Act and the threshold of an amount from The Gift Act and creating our own policy how to contact so that's why we couldn't just say Follow The Gift Act because it's weird in that can I find it cuz it doesn't specify like what's a gift it does okay it does yeah that's the whole first part of it is the definition of a gift it's like two pages that's almost the whole thing and then the limitation is the part that I just read a state officer or employee or candidate isn't it also defines a restricted donor and those people that can't give you gifts and then

[01:23:00]
disclosure so what that what that first sentence is is it's talking about disclosure so there's really two points to it it's if I receive a gift over $250 to $250 I will disclose it but I will also adhere to the limitations on the Gift Act which are very specific within the gift box and Mr attorney

[01:24:00]
gifts that goes under number three and then what number Jackson is suggesting is instead of regardless of value because we got that question that we say over to 250 dollars and using that dollar amount because it aligns with the dollar amount stated in the New Mexico Gift Act but we could pick whatever we want but I do agree with using the 250 so this one we can stick on Corvette Jackson's good comment

[01:25:00]
provisions of the act so how if we add if we added what was that can you read it now become number three how would it read or okay okay so bored members will not request receive or accept loans campaign contributions or gifts for themselves or others that tend to influence them or appear to influence them in discharging their duties as board members board members will disclose to the board Services office and pure board members all gifts over $250 to get over to 250 dollars period board members will adhere to the provisions of the

[01:26:00]
campaign contributions I feel that's different than a gift so I'm just so a gift means any donation or transfer without commensurate consideration of money Property Service loan promise or any other thing about you including food lodging transportation and tickets for entertainment or sporting events but does not include any activity including but not limited to the acceptance of donation transfer contribution or the making of an expenditure and reimbursement that is authorized by the campaign Reporting Act correct which is why the number 7

[01:27:00]
campaign contributions probably shouldn't be in that one but will we take that out because in number three board members will not request for themselves or others attention dollars will adhere to the provisions of the New Mexico and contributions which is not classified as a gift according to the New Mexico Gift Act

[01:28:00]
campaign contribution law okay cuz you have to follow whatever that law is and then just adding the disclosing to all of our board here board I don't know that we are I don't know I don't think we ever get gifts over $250 $200 I don't think Melissa but the tickets to fly somewhere to go to a conference from someone yeah well I think that's exactly the thing like we do get invited to go on trips and so if if I'm invited to go visit a school district in Anaheim because the United Way of central New Mexico is taking a visit to Anaheim I should have to disclose that United Way of central New Mexico to learn about Community Schools don't think that's like important to disclose to disclose that it's already saying that we wouldn't that we're not going to accept it so

[01:29:00]
add that in there as well and then the appear to influence them and discharging their duties as board members and doesn't that go back to that we're not going to make these assumptions about each other if we have appeared to influence in their I don't know this one I'm just having a little bit of a hard time with so and I don't know if it opens us up to I mean I don't know that this would have anything to do with ethics complaints of all like somebody thinks oh well look at how they're voting and they got you know this gift so this way which it may not have anything to do with that that it opens us up to maybe come over to that anyway I mean that's partly why it has the intro statement about public trust the idea of having a code of conduct is holding ourselves to a standard of conduct and since there are currently

[01:30:00]
we need to govern ourselves and put some limitations in there so there may not be so and we could say over $500 over $200 over $100 we could pick whatever we want but I think the point being that according to the s o f g governance it's important for us to have a code of conduct that has these Provisions so and the piece is being around confidential information gets campaign contributions all of the different elements of it so when it comes to gifts like this is our document we can make whatever it is we want remember Jackson has proposed that we disclose them and yeah has proposed moving the language on disclosure but keeping the disclosure and adding a value amount in response to the question of like we get coffee mugs and notepads so we shouldn't have to so so so so perhaps I mean because we're saying board members will not so is it if board members receive

[01:31:00]
a gift that's you know over $250 then they will disclose it because what I'm struggling with is board members will not request receiver except loans because I'm not going to I've never requested assistance from an organization to pay for my travel to go somewhere I just I just haven't done that if an agency or an organization said hey we'd really like to send you to this trip you know I would be willing to disclose that but that's only if I if I receive that gift but and I'm not sure that but what we're seeing here is that you cannot even accept that at all well the way that I read it so we are we going there nobody can so if we got to go there so that the language is what's currently okay that you're reading our current policy reads board members will be prohibited from requesting a receiving and accepting a gift or loan for themselves or another attention

[01:32:00]
add a definition of gifts and a dollar amount of gifts and disclose the gifts or accept that's what you were suggesting which I think it makes more sense I was I was struggling and I will do my full disclosure because I need to do this right now because I was gone out of town so I I'm struggling I didn't catch up with this the best way that I could and it's the first time that I understand it in the context of how we're talking so I think for me I don't like will not request I think I agree is like if work members receive or request I mean I don't even want to say request because I don't know

[01:33:00]
but somebody if if we receive a gift that others might believe could influence me or appear to influence me and discharging my duties as board members then I would adhere to the provisions of the Gift Act and disclose it if board members receive or accepts or others attention and just parking charging their duties as board members they will disclose those to the word Services office and their board members is that the second part of the sentence board members will I guess we need the over we need to integrate the over to 250 in there so what if we start with board

[01:34:00]
they will disclose those to board Services office and pure board members do I need that 2550 so I have a specific example then tell me this so I went to a community school conference in New York if it was paid for by

[01:35:00]
aft National but it was organized through ABC does that mean I could not have accepted that or does it mean I need to disclose that because I'm totally comfortable disclosing it and since I think this needs to address to combine all of these pieces we've made it to complicated so three if three reads board members will adhere to the provisions of the New Mexico Gift Act if board members receive a gift they will disclose to board Services receive a gift over $250 they will disclose to the board Services I like that

[01:36:00]
I think does that work okay I think we are all nodding and we like it and we won't remember it when we have to bless your heart we just said that I wanted to point out is I thinking about this this code of conduct section this this is really the section where we are demonstrating trust to the community right the rest of the document is kind of like our interactions with each other but

[01:37:00]
performing for the the community that they can trust us that we are going to disclose because we we want to get the trust from you so it's kind of how I've been thinking about that but I think those were all that I had okay so then to continue through the Q&A document there's also a proposed rewrite to number five so which currently reads board members will and all instances maintain their conduct at the highest professional and ethical standards and will not engage in activities that violate federal state or local laws or that in any way diminish the Integrity efficiency or discipline of the District board members are subject to the New Mexico governmental conduct which they should become familiar with and follow its Provisions so the proposed change that one is board members are subject to the New Mexico governmental conduct and will in all instances conduct themselves with the highest professional and ethical standards and

[01:38:00]
business conducted by the board with suppliers to the district but I think we need to add like Union as well if we're just putting suppliers to the district about business conducted by the board I think that you should be added to that as well support well this is like suppliers to the district right so they're they're

[01:39:00]
we're just mentioning just suppliers to the district and that's just so like so specific and I don't understand why that's there I mean we could stop it at maybe I think the state law is very specific around vendors and suppliers and business the like nepotism stuff like that that's where there's lots of specificity so I think that's why we have that here will not allow their financial interests to influence business conducted by the board the way I'm interpreting it is like let's say that I own for medium supply company that I will not let that financial interest that I have in that business

[01:40:00]
influence suppliers to the district so it's more my financial interest personally well then board members will not allow their own Financial interests to influence or appear to influence business conducted by the board because that's what you're talking about I think that's what I think it's saying right so you're just saying just to influence business conducted by the board and then just stop it there then I just heard of some instances where because we've got to remember the business of the district and the business of the board right so there's a there's a dollar amount that they're going to go after suppliers that doesn't necessarily have to come through us because it could and so I mean I don't want

[01:41:00]
going to be the board member that influences no you must use only this supplier so I think that's why the supplier is listed in there because it's not just the business of the board but it's really directing and somehow influencing what organization they should buy from or use from so I think that's why it goes to that to that level in my mind that's how I'm interpreting it because I've seen this get some boards in trouble especially at a smaller districts where everybody knows each other you know so I think we just I like the way that it stated just simply because it's not just the the business conducted by the board because we don't conduct the business we want we actually delegate that business but we certainly shouldn't be influencing what suppliers the district should be using which actually goes to the budget policy where it says we only

[01:42:00]
do the funding we don't do the suppliers so I'm not I'm still not understanding where the Union Park go I guess is it I think that also is can influence though and maybe it go somewhere else and I'm good with it going you know it going somewhere else and that's fine I'm still not just so clear about you know when you say you're not clear about because we're talking about District suppliers I think

[01:43:00]
I think they're using the in this sentence I think business business business is being used not as an entity but as a generic term like for board work we will not appear to influence the work that we do with suppliers to the district so I'm wondering so I like for as it is and I'm fine with it but I'm also trying to accommodate your feedback and so if there is a place where you want to watch it I also click through the New Mexico governmental conduct and it does Define all of these things again so in some respects because we're saying that we're subject to the governmental conduct and that we need to read in be familiar with it it says that we will not allow our financial interest to influence us so it's already covered there so we could strike number

[01:44:00]
I'm not sure if people want to weigh in on that how people feel about those trade-offs and that's the whole point of the closed of the disclosure right because we do disclose if we have a financial interest right or something that could appear to influence us what we if we publicly disclose it then it's it's their butt and that's part of the governmental conduct act so I mean I like I like where you say we don't even don't get into the business of suppliers or all that is just short and sweet that we will just not allow our financial interest to influence or peer to influence our business our business is everyone else okay with us

[01:45:00]
business conducted by the board period however given well again we might want to reorder them so number five that actually mentions probably come first so we will maintain contact at the highest Professional Standards will follow the New Mexico governmental conduct so number five become number four and then four or sorry the new five board members will not allow their financial interest to influence their appear to influence board business conducted by the board we can decide to eat that or we can decide to cut it because it's already in the New Mexico governmental contact and I'm putting that to all of us to weigh in and I saw nodding on

[01:46:00]
but totally open to other opinions and perspectives to as to whether we amend it more we just cut it well I mean so then looking at number six or which might be the new bye it talks about disclosure of potential conflicts so I almost wonder if you can totally strike four because you're referencing the governmental contact at and then you're just seeing disclosure and everybody right so I wonder if I'm poor is redundant I'm hearing affirmations and seeing nodding so is there anyone who feels strongly that we ought to keep number for and if so make your case I don't think it's I don't think it's necessary that okay so we will strike

[01:47:00]
and again when we move forward with our motion this will be at 7:00 okay thank you for calling that I skipped over that and the Q&A and had moved ahead to the other one and now my Q&A document closed so the next one is just in the Q&A it's number 7 so we did number five okay so now we're on to number 7 thank you has undergone a lot of edits its in yellow So currently reads board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made the contributions and will recuse themselves from voting on those matters if the contribution is more than one 1000 whether an individual or African amounts unless the board agrees that will result in an inability to fulfill

[01:48:00]
to respond to the concerns and questions that were raised in the last policy committee meeting so we we wanted to keep something on campaign contributions particularly because the Gift Act doesn't cover that and we added the dollar amount of over than a thousand clarified that it's individual or aggregate so if there's a donation that's like 500 + 500 that qualifies and added the unless statement so unless the board agrees that will result in an inability to fulfill its legal obligations so that response to the example that was put on the table what if then four members have to recuse and we know longer have a quorum then we need to talk about that we need to have the disclosure and we need to agree to move forward with fulfilling our legal obligation and hold the vote so it was trying to be responsive to that and again reviewed by our legal counsel so the other thing is there was an example put on the

[01:49:00]
table about donations made from political action committees or cops in the context of the teachers union and does that mean that the members would be required from recusing from the vote on the collective bargaining agreement the answer from our attorney was no that's different so a cop is not the union is not the correct is not the unit the bargains the agreement and so that was the other point of clarification because that was an example that was put on the table so we're still required to publicly disclose those contributions and that's what's in here before matters involving but you're not required to recuse in that example that was put on the table there were other examples that were put on the table in the context of Charter authorizers if a charter authorizer gives me a gift and then two weeks later comes before the board should I recuse myself yes I think that was the other example and I think that there was the

[01:50:00]
so this is an attempt to respond to all of those potential examples of hypotheticals to respond to the concerns around sort of First Amendment rights with with with with the Supreme Court has ruled on campaign contributions falling under that to address the concerns around dollar amounts and then to address the concert around and recusals and legality so I'll stop there and open it up to any other questions or conversation they're edits so then my question is what would this cover will the charter example that I just gave and other things that come to us I think if textbook wanted to fly

[01:51:00]
to California I should recuse that or not I should recuse not just disclose I've made that up but I think anything else do others have examples because I can't I'm making stuff up at this point I mean if you have a contributor who bids obviously on a construction project architectural engineering Etc and they gave you a contribution of that often because we have a lot of the same the same people and I don't think that's fair either and I don't think it's okay for if you go to a contribution from the union that you still would get to vote on the Union contract but yet you wouldn't be able to vote on hiring

[01:52:00]
any money for that there's our opinions on what's fair and it's not but then there's also the legal review in the guidance we got so we can make it to make it more amenable and responsive to every concern around campaign contributions and we're open to those contributions I mean those contributions to the policy but I think that's that that was the correct example was the real estate individual real estate developers who then might have a building construction contractors and so what I had done when I rewrote it I just went on the Secretary of State's website and and just said as required by law school board members will publicly disclose all campaign contributions will abide by the campaign Finance reporting schedule and comply and this is exactly from their website and will comply with campaign Finance disclosure and Reporting requirements as outlined in the

[01:53:00]
that's following all the rules that we have to have to follow but not saying you can't vote we're going to we have to follow all these were made to follow all these but not say you can't vote because somebody gave you a call you know they James Corporation I'm just making one up cuz I came to my mind is bidding to build something and you have to look back and go okay did they give me a contribution and see if they did or not and then you would use yourself right so that's the exact definition of conflict of interest but I think what we're trying to do in there already right so there's a difference to your point between disclosure and recital so all of the disclosure stuff is already captured by the campaign Finance laws and we're already saying about that we're going to follow all federal state and local laws so that's already covered so all of the

[01:54:00]
governing ourselves and committing to hold ourselves to that standard and to recuse ourselves and so if James construction gives me a contribution of $5,000 and then James construction comes before the board as part of a finance committee approval to have the Construction contract on a school I should recuse because that is that is an example of them appearing to influence in me it may not influence me I know nothing about about construction but in the interest of holding myself to that standard of contact I should recuse so I think that's the same thing if a charter operator gives me $1,000 and then they want to charge I should recuse and say I'm refusing because they gave me a campaign contribution I won't like it because I want to vote on it and I like

[01:55:00]
in a way where you don't have to read you get a contribution from the cope which is a different arm which I know that's what was going to happen here is like they're they're a different arms so you're saying they're really not the union because they're the political arm but yet they gave you a contribution and I don't you know when necessarily say that's too influence you to vote for whichever the police officers Union whichever Union it happens to be that that would not appear to influence you to either I'm just clarifying what our legal review determined so if we want to add language that says Additionally you donations from Coke

[01:56:00]
be considered donations from the governing organization and members will recuse like we can have that this is our policy but I was just trying to clarify what our legal review had and why we have the edits we have here so it is open to additional credits if anyone has them and to additional questions if anyone has those I would add that I could you I don't know that I think there's a difference though there's a difference between private and public interest I'm not sure what you mean with that I think

[01:57:00]
unions make a case for the teachers union for public for a public schools right that that taken to account they have a broader impact a broader good impact on the community that's been my experience specifically to Cops and unions and if so we need to discuss that language integrate it and vote on it or not and so I am seeing lots of head shaking to that so I know that you feel that you feel

[01:58:00]
I just want to see if there's others and then we can work with that language as we have been going through the whole rest of the policy I just find it so unfair to certain maybe certain board members you and fairness is a thing but there's also the legal aspect and the ethical and the conduct which is what we're trying to get out so do we want to amend number seven and because this has been the point that we've been on for a while I'll go down the line on this one so remember Peterson how are you feeling about number seven and do you have any proposed edits so I am I am very much on the line with her this is feasible legal helpful in any kind of balanced way even as it stands

[01:59:00]
auto loan if it was referring specifically to Koch contributions the issue of perception there certainly board members that would love to see any of us who in any way shape or form have received Coke contributions would love to have us not vote I have to say with or without those contributions I would still be supporting a negotiated agreement between an employee group and the employer so one can challenge me for weather a donation impacted my vote or not but to call this out in any specific way I think is legally on extremely thin ice I mean we can

[02:00:00]
Annette we could say anyone who received contributions from day off members because they are put out a call for every member to donate 5007 not the hypotheticals board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions through to fulfill its legal obligations how are you feeling about that and are there any changes to that point it is absolutely fine that's part of our Sunshine laws that is public information and should be there and should be completely disclosed I'm off for that the whole thing

[02:01:00]
so going on to the governor that everyone's going to how many hours are there so that a majority will vote on and this is since it's a committee meeting we're making edits so we're accepting edits to get us to I guess what's the winning number so that's what I'm trying to do so we can introduce languages we can vote we can do whatever we want here do you have amendments cuz I'm trying to do is just get something that we can react to and I'm going to go down the line on it so without a doubt if there is a period after board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations you made contributions period I am

[02:02:00]
more than happy to put a period there so I agree with that one too and so you would putting on those matters of contributions when I get that you started with you have questions around the feasibility legality and helpfulness but it is has passed our legal review so that is that is done so next is how are you feeling about number seven and do you have any edits yeah I would I would end up after contributions and delete and will refuse himself

[02:03:00]
is there any edits that you would make to it I would not make any edits to it because I think that again this is about a display and a performance of trust to the community this isn't about me sitting next to you sitting next to you this is about us just plain to the community that they it's a trust exercise right we all do those trust exercises where you fall back and you hope that somebody catches you well I can tell you that I'm going to catch you or I can just play that I'm going to catch you and so in order to be very transparent in order to build trust which is what this entire section is about it's about ethics it's about holding ourselves to a higher standard than is required by law because we are educ

[02:04:00]
eating kids we are in the business of doing that this is a two-pronged approach yes we will publicly disclose any campaign contribution right and we will recuse ourselves if that is over $1,000 that is the display to the public you can trust me that I will recuse myself if there's even the appearance that I might be there might be a conflict of interest so I will display my trust I will display that you can you can trust me by recusing myself I don't think that we can add individual organizations I don't think that we can because it goes against I mean there's Supreme Court there's First Amendment issues here we have Incorporated those issues by discussing unless the rekluse will result in an inability to fulfill a legal obligations this

[02:05:00]
sentence addresses the issues that have been brought up if if I receive a campaign contribution of 5,200 you guys would probably want me to recuse myself from any discussion that is in front of me right you would want me to but the public would want me to so I am perfectly okay with the way that this has been written because I think it it brings in ethics it holds us to a higher standard and it displays transparency and demonstrates trust thank you and I am on the same page as member Jackson and Franklin Library

[02:06:00]
common sense that basic ethical standards to say that is a public official I will recuse myself from something if I have received a campaign contribution that appears to influence me and I think the examples that we put on the table in terms of Charter approvals construction companies whatever those may be are exactly the types of examples and things that happen and I would recuse myself and I would want others to recuse myself as well so that said because this is a working meeting and we're editing the document and the majority of the board thinks that we should have a period after who made the contributions then we will accept that and we want so I think we have gotten through all of the things that are in the Q&A are there other dimensions of this

[02:07:00]
document that people would like to raise for amendments or questions to it as a heavy debate item but going back to board member requirements number three adhere to this board's guardrails or adhered to the board's guards boards guardrails again I'm not sure what what power we have to make someone fulfill that requirement I think the intent is absolutely clear I just look at it and go you know a new board member coming on I think the onboarding is really

[02:08:00]
play critical I think any new board members should fully participate in onboarding I think that makes it really clear why we have the guard rails that we have and why they need to be adhered to but I I just erased it question mark I'm sorry so in my documents it's page 10 it's actually the same page that we've been dealing with more or less it's just number it's number three

[02:09:00]
legal statutory impact to lean on that makes sense to me which is more our responsibilities more than requirements number 64466 thank you for that are there

[02:10:00]
better at questions on the government's menu

[02:11:00]
the first two policies came out of community engagement events and that these policies identify the division and values and so and separating that out from the boards responsibilities in order for the board to carry out its duty to the community for itself and then introduce the delegation policies policies just so that I understand but I will open it up to others for feedback but also I think all of this language came directly from USG so I'm a little reluctant to change it

[02:12:00]
specific set of policies and is divided into four sections gold guard rails delegation and governing just simply making clear that the goals in the guard rails are what the community has identified and issued as a directive to us and that the delegation policies and governing policies are different from that thing they are what we have to do to implement or not I'm staying away from the word correct yeah these are the guidelines necessary to carry out

[02:13:00]
communities vision and the golden guard rails just separating those for that list because it's a little bit 1 me into the other just for the ease of just for the ease of reading and clarifying for the community

[02:14:00]
Tuesday and these policies represent the board work correct yeah just an introductory clarification like even though even though they're like those discussions are embedded in each of the paragraphs I think it would be helpful period so it is saying that that's what the community wanted yeah I guess the point is it does say what you want it to say but it's in the definition of scrolling through the document because I agree with what you just said because I went down to like the delegation policies and it says that you know the delegation believes that Vision goal setting goal monitoring

[02:15:00]
the board will instruct the superintendent so I think it defines the delegation no it doesn't really that's the delegation to the superintendent I'm thinking out loud I'm sorry it's okay I mean it wouldn't it wouldn't hurt I think I don't I'm not I'm not opposed to that minor clarification if that you know that if it's something that you just for clarity you know goals and guard rails are are are activities or parts that were directed by the community what whereas the delegation and the and the government's policies are those things that really are required statutorily or things that are yes carry out the mission of the community

[02:16:00]
I guess that's why I'm struggling a little bit but that's my concern is that I feel like that complicates it even more yeah okay so the first step was Community engagement and having the community identify what they want from us and then the delegation and governing policies are how we get to honoring with the community's

[02:17:00]
but this is how we're evaluating him or her I guess I feel like it says that the delegation that this is what the community wants these two policies represents that we had to do in order to carry out your wishes were determined based on community feedback the second set of policies de

[02:18:00]
are the boards interpretation of how those I'm trying to I'm trying to get to your right what's the language that you are so I like how you started that so help me marry you with this in order for the board to carry out its duty to the communities and so what's what's the best I could do is fulfill the duties to the community and in pursuit of of its directive to us the first two sets of

[02:19:00]
the board in order for it to carry out to its duty to the community's vision and one sentence that makes clear that by way of community engagement events the community identified for the board is vision of values So based on these conversations or somewhere between the goals and guardrails introducing the the next to the last two policies to the community's vision and policies the board developed the following policies for itself so

[02:20:00]
I see what you're wanting to do is kind of to give more information to the community as to how this was developed right okay but my question is is in the introductory paragraph where it starts in 2022 it kind of discusses the process that we went through where it says you know in conjunction with Council of great City Schools we went out to the community we asked what they wanted for their vision and values then we took that and we were going to focus on student outcomes while delegating so it kind of seems like that actually addresses what you're wanting it to but maybe not quite the right words well and it's the kind of that I'm trying to get rid of right I'm trying to be just very clear that so maybe you move up the

[02:21:00]
get to a leadership centers the aps Board of education's work on the communities vision and values and supportive what students should know and be able to do insert the goals and policies and the guard rails policy right there so it's clear here it is and then this government's approach enables the aps board to focus on and evaluate the most important administrative and Management Authority to the superintendent the board will provide for more

[02:22:00]
the intro that has the background on getting Community feedback and how the guardrails were established and the point of delegating the whole lot of nodding and affirmations that most people are comfortable with the current flow here where we describe the the background the sog the difference between the types of the sorry the purpose of the government's approach the purpose of the manual and then definitions for goals policies guard real policies delegation policies and government policies so I think that absent a clearer edit I think most of us are okay with it is

[02:23:00]
but are there suggesting that to maybe not it won't be I mean we've been engaged in this for a while and so I'm questioning whether we but maybe the next step is to have the the public land and I mean my point is I think we're all good enough with this so I think we're good so we can bring this I mean we can bring this back I mean we all the time and we can amend a policy that we just amended six months ago and do it six months from now so I mean I think that's always on the table anyhow so okay and then I just have

[02:24:00]
I just had one more and I don't know yet okay I think it's under the procedures and materials to that be page 36 of the digital but you never know it's on six page 16 of the manual or m board meeting

[02:25:00]
want that to be we would have to move something off consent 4 days before at 4 days before a meeting right I think that's how it's written that it would be moved up to 4 days before the meeting up to 4 days so you would not be able to does this mean that you wouldn't something happened that day you wouldn't be able to move it off consent that I'm understanding that correctly if we wanted it moved off consent you'd have only up to four days before the meeting to do that so you couldn't do it the day of the meeting which goes against anything that Robert's Rules says and I understand that sosg is saying this is can't be changed and it isn't changing an agenda it isn't changing the agenda and the people who if it comes off consent these people already went through and they already know everything anyway so I don't think

[02:26:00]
I don't like that and part of it is that there are times when I will get somebody who reaches out to me about something maybe the day before or the day of and the fact that I wouldn't be able to remove it and according to we have to have some kind of Rules of Order so anytime I would have it any item listed on a consent agenda may be removed for a separate vote of the request of any board member that's what I think it should just say it should be that simple but if you want to remove something it can be removed for separate vote not giving for days before I think very very very very very very very very very few times is anything ever removed from the consent agenda what is concerning then if you know you have four days you only have up to four days and you don't know what a constituent might ask you or you don't know that

[02:27:00]
question might end up coming up that just comes to you then what I fear is that the consent whole consent agenda item will just be removed 4 days before just in case something happens so if we have it like this I think it would be much better and Robert's Rules have been around for like $150 years and no offense but cancel great City Schools hasn't been around that long no fantastic on a consent agenda may be removed for a separate vote at the request of any board member the number 9 goes down to say No Agenda items will be added to a remove from the consent agenda during the meeting so that would have to just get updated as well well I mean I I think the point is is that anything that's coming to an agent

[02:28:00]
send agenda has been discussed right it's already been discussed and so it seems to me that if there was something that was already discussed and there would be plenty of time to say I'm not going to be voting in favor of this or I'm going to have a difference of opinion way in advance of that meeting it doesn't seem like it would just come up on that day I just can't imagine because I'm just going to I'm going to use like an example like I think during some discussions that we've had where you clearly are not in agreement with something during the committee meeting and you were not in agreement with that and it's now being pushed to consent because it passed you know with the whole board I mean the majority of the board but now it's coming to consent you would know before 4 days before that you want to have it pulled you

[02:29:00]
which does happen sometimes I just think especially now when we haven't heard from the finance committee that they're going to be some of those items that are just automatically like on on consent right I mean we don't know exactly what those are I just think this is just a way to make sure that you know we're not going for days before and going oh my goodness I hope that I don't have somebody asked me a question and I have to pull everything which is ridiculous because I can count the times that that I personally have years have pulled something off consent it's been very very very very seldom so maybe there's a way to clarify to get to a president what we're talking about here is items that have already been discussed in a committee and so board members

[02:30:00]
the finance committee meeting and then we have the special board right away and everything just goes on so there isn't you would never have those for if something came up you know how you'd never have those four days before so let's take a policy committee meeting we just wanted to pass the policy on guardrails and so it's going to go on to the consent for the next meeting we've had the discussion already and so you need to have pulled you need to pull it off four days before which is different from the example that we were talking about with the finance committee where there's a whole bunch of questions and things are really weedy then we'll take it and we'll have the discussion so I think those are two different things and I think the question is how do we make that clearer in the language

[02:31:00]
4 days but I mean there's a reason we have the four days and so out of respect to our staff and their time but also to follow the Sophie guidance and so if it's board members will have up to 4 days before the meeting to request items to be removed from the consent agenda and placed in the action for discussion like I'm trying to figure out how we clarify and address your concerns because I agree with put on the agenda it's different because I see what you're trying to get at is what they're saying here is up to four days whenever possible board member me to go on that we can pull it off so that we can pull it on and follow the open meetings act saying this one is going to have a special going to have its own conversation and I think if we say something like if possible I mean use a word that like that

[02:32:00]
like you know we would want to because that makes it easier we want to make it easier on everybody I don't think any of us want to make it more difficult on staff so if we would just add if possible 4 days up to 4 days before would that work well then I mean I think there's still number nine but I wanted to I was I didn't even look at number nine so I told you this stuff here I'd love to call you on and get your guidance Ashley on this one as well in terms of what's actually rules how do we follow the New Mexico meetings act how do we adhere to sfg and is there a way yes so Robert's Rules of Order is and so Robert's Rules of Order is not a so the Rules of Order are not a governance process it is a process by which you manage meetings and I actually am not familiar with any

[02:33:00]
specific element of Robert's Rules of Order that dictates how consent how the consent calendar is used or how items are pulled off there is there are elements of the of Robert's rules that lays out how that how the meeting and how it the consent calendar is handled in the meeting the actual meeting process but it's more of a process it is rules of process More Than This is how things have to be done and also Robert's Rules is the Robert's Rule serves to provide a backup or so a default Rules of Order default parliamentary procedure for the way that organizations deliberate of bodies are managed it's but body can always create its own process

[02:34:00]
says that are more specific and that work for that body so as so that's that is the so the answer the question about Robert's Rules it actually doesn't it there's nothing in Robert's rules that says that this is how consent agendas have to be have to be held or if there is and I'm not aware of it I'm certainly open to being corrected on that so that's the first thing the second thing is this just the Genesis of where this recommendation comes from in the framework and its really to to create processes that are more effective for your staff and your community and for each other and so ideally all of this work will have been handled before the meeting and so right now it may be true

[02:35:00]
people from the community call and say oh I've got a question about this this piece of this piece of legislation that is on the consent calendar I'd like to make sure that it gets answered it's not so it is the board's decision over whether or not that gets pulled and the recommendation that things be pulled before prior to 40 days before is really so that the the conversation that has had in the board meeting is well-planned and well thought out and so if you have people that are pulling items off of the consent agenda to have excessive deliberation about those items in the meeting the staff and the so the staff and the board should be able to have notice of that and be able to have have it laid out that that is going to happen

[02:36:00]
of course you don't have to I mean the majority of boards don't have this process it's up to your board you have to choose how you're going to make your meetings the most efficient and how you're going to set the community up so if you let your community know beforehand before the meeting is posted what items will be discussed and which items will be decided by consent and that's one thing pulling items off for discussion and deliberation within that 4 days window is really to really the impact on that is not giving staff the amount of time needed to adequately prepare but again it's the board's decision so I just provide the coaching you all have to make the decision about what's going to work best for you great thank you and so as with the other

[02:37:00]
the other things that we've discussed tonight will go through a similar process and just see if there's feedback or edit suggestions based on board member molarity guns suggested that it's to number 7 how do people feel about this member Jackson I certainly understand I mean we've all gotten the calls the day of and so I understand that but I also feel like we're going through a pretty significant Community training exercises as well with the switch to governance and you know I did deal with some customer issues this week superintendent thank you which I shouldn't have done and I appreciate the super I appreciate you superintendent thank you but if something has gone to consent agenda it is because it has already been discussed

[02:38:00]
and it is already been deliberated and it has already gone through the process that it needs to go through and so I'm comfortable with leaving it as written because I think not only are we needing to retrain the community on what it is that we do I think we are also need to retrain ourselves as to what is efficient governance so I think I'm fine with the way it is thank you to others have any strong opinions or edits that you would like to voice I will concur with board member Jackson and I agree with that statement for sure I mean because I think we're talking specifically about those things that have already been deliberated and there's already had that conversation so I only concern I mean in general I agree but this sort of goes back again to the

[02:39:00]
events committee conversation if we have a subgroup that is making decisions and calls on finance issues then it's going to be absolutely essential that full board discussion be allowed now that means now the whole of the discussion that's going on in between the budget and finance policy to to this moment to think back to that that it's going to be essential that if indeed there is some smaller than the whole body

[02:40:00]
making proposals and decisions there needs to be an expectation that there will be ample opportunity to pull things off of consent to be ample opportunity to have a conversation and that exchange right and more than just being informed that having an opportunity to participate which I think is what we have said that we would do I guess I am I agree there should be an apple opportunities with this commitment that

[02:41:00]
what does are published 14th to me to be ample opportunity plus you had the period for discussion during the prior meeting plus you had the Q&A session time frame so I think I'm with a member Jackson but I also want to see if there is an edit that people want to suggest that will make them feel better it's certainly requires discipline on our part for sure right because we have to meet those deadlines around getting our questions in and you know because the staff is already got to be disciplined themselves to return to responses and for us to be prepared for that doing our research doing our homework it requires a lot of discipline and I think that is one of those changes that may I

[02:42:00]
play have any agendas ahead of time having information way ahead of time having the opportunity to ask questions I know that there are times when you know that deadline comes and I go shoot you know I think we all have had that oh shoot moment and we have the conversation with Johannes like oh shoot you know but I think this is us putting our best foot forward around this governance because it's not just the Whirlwind that we create you know when we are up here and it looks like a whirlwind but it's really the world when we create all so for staff so it's it's really just trying to be efficient and effective with our time and using just you know being disciplined and I think it's I think it's something to strive for so I think I have it okay so further down in section 4 I is the section on board committees which is a slight rewrite of our policy on board committees so committee's

[02:43:00]
some of the language that we were talking about in the finance committee conversation which was all committee meetings are open to all members they're posted publicly all materials are available I guess it's those two things like if we add that here that these are transparent the information is available anyone can join anyone has everybody has an opportunity to engage and delivery does that address the other issue about that I'm good with that as well under four I won three

[02:44:00]
ER members can join or all meetings are opened all members or something like that and then asks if they're all posted publicly and all the materials are available is the third was that anything that works additional conversation I don't know that that's needed here but do you guys are all available not having access to information and making sure that things are fully deliberated prior to that 4 days deadline

[02:45:00]
I just don't know how hard it is to just say board members should request up to 4 days before the meeting that items to be removed from the consent agenda I think it was it was Ashley's explanation so to be clear there are things that I am really not happy with this too but I can restate those but I do think since we are trying to get to yes and we are accommodating all of the feedback and edits and there's lots of affirmation on this one I think we might be okay with moving on from that one period so are there so there is no edit to 47 or number 9 are there other proposed

[02:46:00]
all right so yes Barbara sorry yes number Peterson I have a real quick question about 40 public participation at board meetings this is just a simple technical question what does it mean to say APS reserves the right to summarize public comments in the meeting minutes does that mean that we don't have to but the maker of the minutes can decide whether or not they do it I think what it means is you know that sometimes they're people are very wordy and what they're saying and I think what it's it's just implying is that they reserve the right to condense the 2-minute statement down to an overall topic

[02:47:00]
summarize public comments in the meeting minutes just because I don't think comments or whatever transcribed they're all but it seems like they're always summarized I like removing reserves the right I was just saying APS will summarize public comments in the meeting minutes okay thank you for that any other suggestions is going to summarize the edits the Amendments that have been made and we're all going to take notes and follow along and then we'll go to approve his message that we're making to the governor's manual okay bear with me yes all right starting
