[00:00:00]

[00:01:00]
and for District 1 includes the Atrisco Heritage Academy in Rio Grande High School areas District 2 includes the civil law and Volcano Vista High School areas in District 4 includes the Highland High School area my name is Angela Gonzalez and I am the executive director of the Southwest Institute for transformational Community Schools which is more commonly known as Swift Community Schools and I'll be your moderator for tonight's Forum this forum is also being streamed live on YouTube and will be archived on the aps.com edu website the order of answering questions will be rotated for each question the candidates from District 1 to District 2 and District 4 participated in a drawing earlier this week to determine District order and speaker order they are seated in the order drawn questions were gathered from the community to try to address as many issues as possible

[00:02:00]
combined questions on the same topic questions asked and those not asked will be posted on the aps website each candidate will have one minute for opening remarks and generally 1 minute to respond to each question I may increase or decrease the response time depending on the number of questions the complexity of the question and the amount of debate time remaining timekeepers tonight or up here Dr Chris Meyer who is executive director of student family and community supports and this Shannon Barnhill who is executive director of the aps Education Foundation so due to our limited time together tonight let's get started we'll begin with our opening remarks from our candidates for District 1 there are three candidates running to represent District 1 on the aps board three candidates running in District 2 and 2 candidates running in District

[00:03:00]
each candidate has been asked to share one minute opening statement and we will start with Mr Verlander who is running in District 1 Mr Coker thank you I want to start by kind of setting the tone and remind the other candidates that it's not necessarily an accomplishment to speak on how much you care about the kids or how long you've been in the district these things are prerequisites to the position I have the request that you try to keep focus on the crisis that is in front of us of APs student outcomes are in the toilet and have been for decades statistically speaking about 11:10 every year in this city and right now APS is not doing a good job taking care of them or giving them an adequate Future these are the things that we need to start talking about and actually looking forward to and again just as a final reminder that we are in crisis and APS does need more than just platitudes we need leaders thank you Mr Coker also running in District 1 Mr Robert through here

[00:04:00]
everybody my name is Robert Trujillo I was born and raised in the South Valley I'm a product of APS and I've been serving my community and district one for over 25 years from originally building programs and schools in District 1 APS schools in District 1 to also advocating for the ydi daycare to come to the South Valley CNM campus these are just a couple of reasons why I am the only candidate in District 1 to have all of the Educators endorsements as well as the central labor Council and also some of our elected officials like Senator Michael Padilla representative of Andres restaurant in my son I know the struggles that are that our community

[00:05:00]
has and that's what I'm here to fight for thank you thank you Mr Trujillo the third candidate from District 1 is Miss Janelle astorga hello everybody my name is Janella I'm very excited to be here with you as the youngest person running for the board I have been working to fight inequities in Education System since I was 13 years old so I have a very vast experience of understanding students and where they come from and how teachers deserve a lot more within the system of APs I am again very excited to be a voice for students and understand that as a young person I am the closest person in the on this board right now to the education system and what students are facing so I just appreciate the space and being able to talk with you all today thank you thank you Mr got now we're turning to District 4 first up is Mr Stephen checkol good afternoon everyone

[00:06:00]
thank you guys for being here my name is Steve checco I am running for APS District 4 I've been a long time resident of the district in 25 plus years a small business owner of three students that have come through the system already also I'm passionate about community service and helping others I really want to help bring the school system up we we need to get out of the basement that's where we are there's some really good strategic plans that are about to go into place and I'm really excited to be able to participate in that so thanks again for being here and our second candidate from District 4 is good evening everyone to see such strong Community engagement

[00:07:00]
I am passionate about public schools I attended Public Schools my husband attended Public Schools our daughter did my mother-in-law was a teacher for 30 years and my mother is a proud 1975 graduate of Highland High School I am running for this position because I'm a parent and I'm concerned I don't like that our children have become political pawns I don't like that their education is at risk every child has a right to a public education where they feel comfortable world where they learn in a safe environment when that prepares them for college or career when they graduate I am running to protect that right and I'm running to get the resources to the school so that the teachers can be supported in doing their work thank you thank you thank you this we turned out to District 2 we have three candidates first up is Mr Adrian Nogales hello my name is Adrian Nogales I'm a sixth grade social studies teacher with APS I have been with the district as a substitute in EA administrator

[00:08:00]
a variety of roles test coordinator and I've seen many different jobs in the district and how they all play a big part in the overall picture I wanted to talk tonight a lot about the law breaking that's going on in the aps hierarchy and the people negotiating the contract it's a small team of about 18 people and they're deciding a 2.2 billion dollar budget and they're just spending a lot of funds in a really negative way that's impacting our students negatively last one I want to say I don't know who scheduled this for on Yom Kippur but I do want to apologize to the Jewish Community that's like having this debate on Easter and it's very culturally insensitive from the same district that is being told they are culturally insensitive with martinez perfect example I do apologize for the Jewish Community District 2 is Miss Peggy Miller going to start this thank you for

[00:09:00]

[00:10:00]
I'm really glad to see everyone here especially friends and close people I work through without the commute with throughout the communities for numerous years I have been an advocate for our children with disabilities only because my children one were graduates of high school but I found that advocating for my oldest son with a disability was one reason why I had to learn special education law educational law and the processes of Education I know and understand the struggles are parents and students and teachers are educators are going through and I am an education Advocate with experiences working with our schools on local state and federal levels I'm really I'm here not only to tell you that we need to restore balance within our schools we have been in an immense State and I hope to not only

[00:11:00]
kids with disabilities and those families who don't have a voice thank you candidates and before I move to our questions from the community I do want to welcome I've been told that we have over 20 guests that are in our overflow room so there's a lot of interest in tonight's debate or candidate forum and so welcome to all of them that are here tonight we are now going to turn to our questions that were submitted from the community and this first question will go to mister Trujillo this is a one minute question and we'll go just in order all the way down first question is what is your educational philosophy and how would that philosophy impact your decision-making and votes so I come out this into this race with an open mind on just how diverse district one is there are so many different kids and it's definitely not a one size fits all we need to

[00:12:00]
make sure that all of our kids feel safe and in a good learning environment and feel comfortable and also with with being able to get pregnant in there and to just kind of collaborate with the teachers or that so there's there's really not a one-size-fits-all it's it's for each of our individual students and her diverse District thank you so much I believe that teachers know best when it comes to educating our students because they are the ones that are in the classroom I also believe in transparency and making sure that Community is involved every step of the way when providing curriculum updates or any type of policy change from the board one of the biggest things that I support is Service Learning and making sure that students do have access to different Avenues of testing or program project

[00:13:00]
has been linked to a lot of anxiety which we face now especially in schools with mental with the lack of mental resources within our education system so different ways for students to really show that they are learning and that there's different Avenues to learn is very big thank you Mr chuckle you have one minute APS is very diverse specially in my district in the International District the children there have many many different needs and we have to meet them where they are at so the way that I would vote is to make sure that all children regardless of their background or able to drive in there

[00:14:00]
environment and we set them up for success and the tools they need to move forward through life thank you Miss going to be this you're up next I think that children can succeed they have amazing potential and it's up to all of us the community the schools the administrator the board it's up to all of us to make sure that they can succeed and we can work together to do that I trust teachers their license professionals I trust that they're doing their job we need to make sure they have the resources to do their job we need to make sure that the students who need extra help get that help we need to make sure that our students with disabilities get the resources and accessibility that they need children are our greatest resource their greatest hope and we need to do everything we can do to make sure they can succeed that's our job

[00:15:00]
external Palace thank you I'm going to go ahead and read a quote to everyone from last week's school board meeting September 20th from outgoing superintendent Scott Helder and I quote otherwise we are going to move to a system like I see done in other states where they just bring in unlicensed people they're basically just putting people in the classroom and saying thanks for showing up hope you know what you're doing and I just don't see good outcomes in that but that's where we're headed definitely a local emergency that's where we're headed my educational philosophy is if you don't have teachers in the classroom there's not a real good education taking place I have 34 students in six different classes and buy New Mexico state law it says that I should only have 24 six or seven of those students are special education I do my best to give them a minute of my time but 34 students in a 55 minute class is unattainable to reach any of your goals and there are no guards to protect from that you need to hire

[00:16:00]
they are all all really good at something and we must do everything we can to bring that out and we can do that first by funding with the kids need we have to have the funding in order to get them the resources that they need we can make sure that there's choices that parents are listening to that there are smaller classes that children are not hungry that they are well taken care of and their social emotional needs are met so there's a there's a big list but I know we can do it and the funding is there with over three billion extra dollars that we're going to have we know we can do everything for our kids that they need what I talked to

[00:17:00]
earlier about bringing balance back into education I do have some Central philosophies and this comes from South Dakota with our Lakota people if our children belong then they will Master if they Master then they will be independent if they are independent then they will create generosity but many times in our schools we look at more isolation we look at failure and we look at dependents and we also look at selfishness show me anytime there's an imbalance that's occurring and we don't seem to try and figure out why is this occurring so I believe that if our children at least are giving the basic neither basic needs of our kids with disabilities that we can set this balance thank you and Mr Coker well for me much like with Ronaldo is a lot of what I preach is 21st Century Learning and a lot of that is traditional Knowledge from the indigenous peoples we've got our children of years

[00:18:00]
in particular I'm noticing that there is a lot of teachers know best and to be quite Frank that's not necessarily the case this isn't a you know a knock against them is more so they don't have the skills to do so even if they do there's retaliation for Innovative practices there is not enough resources to actually facilitate these things that are technology in the classroom required to do their job properly it's not just that you just need to be able to have these resources we also need vast training for the vast majority of teachers to actually get them to a 21st century knowledge base one of the other problems that have noticed at least with the when it comes to philosophy is this idea of diversity meaning that we have something special or something detrimental to APS that modifies at our way that we should be teaching thank you Mr Coker we'll turn to our second question now and this is the first one will be for you this is a one minute question

[00:19:00]
what is the main mission of APS and is APS fulfilling that mission thank you I believe the one mission of APs is to have our students be successful when it comes to their education system and for post-graduation and right now as we know what the Ozzie Martinez case that has not been fulfilled and we are still lacking some of the implementation for even good policies that have been implemented that have been said to us right so not only are we in the funding like one of the board candidates have said but the implementation is just not there we are now seeing more and more Community Schools which is really great but if we don't have the actual skills to implement good policies with that funding or with those resources then we're doing a disservice to our students students have been for many many years over a decade saying that the same problems are still there one of the biggest things that students have expressed to me over the span of five years is that racial inequities is very high within the district so that's one of the biggest things that I want to focus on

[00:20:00]
and ensuring that we're not just throwing around policies with the implementation is there thank you thank you Mr chetco so the main mission that I see for APS is to educate our children get them ready for Life After High School and moving into the rest of their life so if we don't get our out if we don't get our outcomes up and we don't get teach at a grade level then we're going to be doing to the children we have the funding it's got to be appropriated in the right places we need some changes we need to focus on improving those outcomes the math the reading that type of thing and we want

[00:21:00]
bring the families into it somebody had mentioned a community schools that's a really good idea it's you've heard the expression it takes a village well there you go to this certainly what is the main mission of APS and is APS fulfilling that mission according to the website is educating and caring for our diverse student population supporting their families and partnering with the community with the promise of a better future for all that's a fantastic Mission I believe that APS is educating and caring for our diverse student population I believe APS is supporting our families I believe their partnering with the community with the promise of a better future for all or else you all wouldn't be here right now but can we do better yes we can make sure that that 2 billion dollars is appropriated where it

[00:22:00]
used to be appropriated appropriately we can make sure and expand our community schools especially in District 4 where they're really necessary we can make sure and hold teachers and administrators accountable accountability is so important thank you Mr Nogales yeah I just want to go ahead and say to my school and to everyone that my opinion is do not reflect anyone at my school they are my own and you guys let me into a tough conversation that I've been just waiting to get at and so the most important thing APS can do is provide a safe School environment in school hours we had 17 guns taken in our school district last year at the schools we had four shootings at West Mesa High School the district said oh it's a societal issue that part of town is that what you mean so I just don't see the district doing anything I don't see

[00:23:00]
please at the schools we've had four guns taken at our schools this year and all the candidates on the only one that even raised that up in the candidate questionnaire and that is of great concern to me you're all well-spoken you all watch the news I'm sure if our schools aren't safe we're just a 20.00 box of bullets away from raising a 50 million school like they did at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland or Valley Elementary Miss Miller out of one so I mean the main mission of APs obviously is to educate our children to make sure they're prepared to live in the world after after graduating they have to be prepared academically they have to make sure that they are at grade level that they are social social and emotionally ready and that they are safe and they are respected and that they have relationships with people and that will speak a lot to how safe they feel who can they go to at the schools that is something that

[00:24:00]
when we are focusing now on making sure our children are ready at 3rd grade early literacy 8th grade math making sure that they are there's post-secondary Readiness and also that they are ready with life skills thank you talk about education our children and making sure that they have the opportunities when they graduate advocating for our children and helping families and IEPs and helping kids graduate and I'm finding that many of our children with disabilities especially this year don't even have the required reading and writing skills so it's one to get on this board and to not only advise people what is going on with our kids with disabilities but it's also to create that voice for the

[00:25:00]
guidance as a parent so I'm hoping not only with our children that it's it's also another thing where we are not recognizing Community involvement our voice and how do we pass on these areas of concern to the community I think there's a big divide there Mr Coker can you repeat the question please what is the main mission of APS and is APS fulfilling that mission do you mean like the main reason for me what we should be doing is preparing students for the unfairness that surrounds them when they come out of high school and in particular if we were to actually look at ourselves and determine whether or not we're fulfilling that we aren't we lose thousands of students every year from graduation and that's not even including the amount of students that we lose in middle school that just aren't

[00:26:00]
cracked and anyone who states that weird even doing a remotely good job it's quite frankly a shameful response but I don't really understand about a lot of what we do here is how much we're willing to abandon and how many students were willing to let go again this is thousands of students of every year and I you know I was one of them and a lot of my friends are one of them but we're not even statistics when it comes to what we should be doing we are so far away from that that to me it requires a very much an in-depth look at ourselves in terms of what how we're doing what we're doing and whether or not it's even worth continuing a lot of the taxes that we are right now you have the last word on this question thank you so I believe that APS right now is starting to hit in the right direction with their student outcomes and their new goals and guardrails I do fully support that and I was on the board I would

[00:27:00]
why can't we be working to those another thing that I would add to that is also bringing in Union apprenticeship programs and for to get high school students and possibly even look into introducing into middle school students so there's more than one pathway it's not just College again not a one-size-fits-all we need to be diverse with our kids but we need to continue to to help them to thrive and just bring Google's for them thank you all right we're moving to our third question with this one this is one minute question many teachers would love to have every student come in physically and mentally healthy fat and loved but unfortunately that is not always the case what are your suggestions for helping these students through their trauma again as I mentioned before it takes a village so

[00:28:00]
we need to do is to have a collaboration between the community the families the teachers and get these kids fed make sure that they're getting some sleep and unfortunately I mean that's really not what's happening many folks in my district are struggling period so they want to make sure that they can eat and they're not so much taking care of the children the way that they would want so if the community steps in and helps out with that along with our school system I think we have a better shot at raising better children healthier children thank you thank you

[00:29:00]
happens in the first few years of their life before they even reach school and it's important to remember that and I think that the early childhood education that's been developed is a good step in that direction I think that we need to address poverty Healthcare disparity all of the things that people go through that the school board doesn't necessarily have a say in this is before the child's even gotten to the classroom but once the child is there I think we need to invest in more social emotional learning make sure there are social workers in the schools who can address these issues and give teachers a safe space to be able to report when they need to Mr Nogales I think I've worked out a lot of schools and as a substitute I just about worked in all of them unless they were building the last five years to me you could go and look at the school that I'm

[00:30:00]
right now and see the wraparound Services we have a support as an example of what they're not doing in the other schools that I was coming from I'm actually pleasantly surprised I was part of the right-sizing where they just sent a bunch of teachers to different schools and eliminate a bunch of positions so I didn't even apply to the job I'm at right now but I am very impressed we had a I'm a sixth grade social studies teacher the seventh grade social studies teacher passed away last night actually and yeah she was beautiful person beautiful eyes and our school just had great wrap around support for staff for students we had a really horrible instant last week for two teachers were attacked and you know we had to go into like a lockdown type in and we had such great Services provided by the district and through our own staff and more things like that throughout the district I don't see another schools Miss Miller thank you so what we really need to do is make every school a community school

[00:31:00]
that way they all have the wraparound services that we know every child no matter where they live needs we need to have mental health therapist in our school we have to have enough counselors in our school we can't have a counselor who has to service three or four hundred children they don't get the relationships and they don't get the time that they need that those are the most important things as far as right now with universal meals that is that's a great thing but what we need to do is we need to realize that we probably have to add for a lot of children a second helping that they don't get with the universal meal they get one meal and I've heard from many people that have said the kids are hungry but they don't have the money and they have to buy the second meal that is wrong on so very many levels so those are the main things that I think that we should be doing focus on our kids focus on those relationship make sure they're healthy and every way socially emotionally and physically miss tomorrow thank you I know

[00:32:00]
covid the one area that I have found within not only data is that we have lacked in trying to really figure out how we are and what has occurred with covid how many families have we lost how many teachers did we lose how many how many of our kids have went through trauma my family was greatly affected with the 1918 influenza and orphans occurred how many orphans do we have in the school district how many people went homeless because of covid that Dad is not out there and I would hope that we would try and obtain that because there's so many traumas of affiliated with that and I hope that it would also become a great concern for our district that we would not only stop for a moment but we got to consider what is the data from covid and how many children did we lose and why are they not here thank you Mr Coker the question please certainly many teachers would love to have

[00:33:00]
physically and mentally healthy fat and loved but unfortunately that is not always the case what are your suggestions for helping these students through their trauma okay we've had this conversation about three times in the last 5 years that I've been doing advocacy at APS we had a string of about eight sides and one school in Spanish a year not much has changed a big solution is to just throw counselors at the problem but it's very similar to a workplace counselor in the sense that would work is to help you work through the trauma of doing your job and the inequities and the violations that happen at that job so you don't you notice that you don't work together with a co-workers or you don't quit very much the same way we're not really looking at what it is where we're putting our kids through in the classroom a lot of truancy are because they just don't want to be in the classroom either there's two boring the teachers mean to him or whatever it is we need to make schools a place where they want to be and on top of that we need to start showing the school day and expanding before and after school programs the last time they spend a harmful

[00:34:00]
this is the reality of many of our students and that's the solution to get there and it's it's not just throwing counselors at the problem thank you mister Trujillo yes so this issue I think is a little bit bigger than APS the bottom end of course is APS but again people when I get put on the board the people that I've been working with for the past 25 years are also coming with me I come with the team so like that did have the universal breakfast and lunch pass for all kids the free or free Universal breakfast and lunch we work with these we work with these people we collaborate with them I'm also collaborating with with another group that's doing work for social emotional learning and all that stuff needs to be to be brought in I have these

[00:35:00]
resources I've been working with them for many many years and I've seen the problem for a long time especially in District 1 Miss Astoria thank you I heard many good ways that we can tackle this issue there was talk about the universal lunch and also Community Schools and I do agree with the Community Schools model but again we can't just be throwing these labels at our schools without full implementation and skill building and leadership development within our staff I also want to just take time to think the teachers who are moms dad's social workers everything within the classroom because that is who they are that is what the job has become because of poverty because of how our state is made up so one of the things that I just want to add some of the other candidates statements is APS does Lobby we can help our students families by lobbying for more SNAP benefits to be issued throughout this

[00:36:00]
I need that extra help the class schedule that has now been implemented does not work for students who are working after school and now get out later than they have to thank you all right we're moving to our next question Miss benavidez you'll have the first answer the question is what is your definition of high quality instruction what would you expect to see in a classroom daily my definition of high quality instruction is instruction that obviously meets the standards of the curriculum is diverse cultural Lee sensitive is appropriate for the students can be changed based on the different needs of the students and the levels that they're at and which I know varies from class to class from student to students I'm sorry can you tell me the second part of the question what would you expect to see in a classroom daily I would

[00:37:00]
be able to ask questions have their needs met their questions answered whether they're pertinent to the the lesson or if they need help in other areas they need to be nurtured they need to feel safe and that's the only way they're going to succeed one minute you're so high quality instruction the number one component of that is that it is engaging to the students if they're turned out they're not paying attention to whatever the teachers putting down so one thing that the New Mexico public education department and APS could do is ease off of the teachers on all the requirements that go beyond anything we're doing in the classroom they've just got a whole bunch of bogus requirements that they put on teachers this year and we're being watered down with excessive trainings that don't really serve anything

[00:38:00]
micro credentialing that's ongoing you've got to do all these hours and it's really hard for teachers to focus on the students if we have all these other things going on and 80 hours of training is required by all teachers this year and those are those 10 extra days they added to our school year but it's Mueller thank you when it comes to high quality instructional materials the thing that we have to see is we have to make sure that it is meeting the needs of all the kids in the classroom that it is rigorous responsive to the needs that it is challenging the kids in a way that it makes them rise higher that's what's important and that's what the kids asked for they wanted

[00:39:00]
that they were doing what they should have been doing I would see that none of the kids would be bored they would all be uplifted and that I would see that the standards were being taught and I would see that teachers were not talking at the children but rather that they were engaging the children at their level and challenging them academically in every way that they possibly can thank you mister I think that many times we often forget that our children need to belong they need to belong in the school they need to belong in the classroom and they need to belong to the community is if they don't belong then they won't Master whatever that Community or that classroom wants to teach then if they can't master

[00:40:00]
I can succeed I can make decisions for myself many times we forget that belonging instead we isolate instead we produce failure because we can't master and then an independence we also do dependents so much and in our generosity we've also created selfish so we can never you know conclude that these areas are all of concerned to create the learning we need to Mr Coker can you repeat the question please what is your definition of high quality instruction and what would you expect to see in a classroom daily well for me I want to be able to walk in and even classroom and see creativity I don't want to walk in and see rows of death I want to see soon as working on something I want to see Project based learning no less I want to see students you know

[00:41:00]
creating Shakespearean versions of you know plays based on their own culture I want to see them working together engineering some collaborative contraption that can be shown off at an exhibition you know later in the year and these things that I'm listening have been done before they've been done very specifically at High-Tech high as the charter school in the nation and students can do these things are accomplished in these things this is what high quality instruction looks like it doesn't look like anything like what we're doing now that's really what I want to see that is the future that we want to get to you thank you I see high quality instruction as us listening to our teachers I don't know how to teach a kid but that's what our teachers are here for we need to listen to him we need to see what they need and then we need to collaborate and come back on that

[00:42:00]
again very very diverse District very different learning styles for every kid I would hate to you know walk into a classroom and see the same thing going on for all the kids in the classroom again the teachers need to be able to use their judgment and to be able to see what types of kids they have and to continue to help them Thrive and also to you know to meet these goals in the guard rails that the board has set thank you it provides a sense of ownership that you can go out into the street and you've done something for your community they recognize that you're out there as a student and someone who cares you're a student who cares so we have models like that at different schools which I just believe the greatest component of Education because it provides critical

[00:43:00]
collaboration and engagement which are three things that students need in order to be successful host graduation I also want to make sure that the 20% of Ale ESL students that we have within our education or our district within this education system are not only getting passed on so that they can graduate but are getting challenging Core Curriculum because right now that is not what's happening so when we say that we want all of our students to succeed and have high quality instruction we need to make sure that we're all including those who have different language barriers thank you thank you Mr chuckle oh I'd like to see well trained teachers that engage the children in grade level outcomes their grade levels they challenged the kids with critical thinking and having fun while they're doing it if they're engaged

[00:44:00]
and they're not bored then you're out comes are going to be a lot higher quality than if you just speak at them all day thank you this next question will start with Mr Nogales question mark and science what should be done to improve student proficiency you know I'm getting students now that are arriving to me in the sixth grade that can't read they can't spell Albuquerque kindergarten in early childhood education if you look last year at the vacancies in the school district there was four vacancies for kindergarten

[00:45:00]
and every school it would only cost $450 to put a little free library in front of your school I don't see a little free library in any schools I double as a pantry there's some schools that have them very few things like that got to think outside the box we've got to go after the Early Childhood thank you so when it comes to low proficiency it is then obviously a long-term problem for APS but when I look at at the problem all I see I see a pretty simple solution is every child can learn and if the adults in the room believe that that's exactly what's going to happen so our

[00:46:00]
always talks about student outcomes won't change until adult behaviors change so once we change that mindset of the people the adults in the room going to happen because they're going to believe that those kids can learn at grade level and Beyond I think that's the simplest solution change in adult mindset you can change those student outcomes for every single child no matter where they go to school and no matter what level they're at what I that's what I believe and that's what I've seen have you been a teacher for as many years as I I did teach thank you thank you so much I'm going to come off on the perspective of what I've been seeing and IEP it's been pretty sad to see that we would graduate a kid a student sorry that wouldn't even have the basic requirements to read

[00:47:00]
are you mad and hope that they're going to become viable citizens we have to figure out do we really know and have the relationships we need with our students we have a great shortage of teachers we have unqualified teachers especially when special education how are we going to follow those goals and those accommodations and modifications are really concerned about special education and many children staying at home doing online learning thank yous have low Proficiency in reading math and science what should be done to improve student proficiency

[00:48:00]
but until I actually see these tests I am not really going to have any idea but I think what's very pertinent for this is I was substituting a Kindergarten class and these adorable little kids were so excited to show me the workbooks this is a special needs class where they weren't they were falling behind they're very excited show me what they were doing because I was happy to see them you know and I wanted to know what they were doing but that really wasn't where I saw the literacy being expressed where the actual Intelligence being expressed where it was was they were doing their little mama jokes to each other most adorable thing but the metaphors that they were implementing and the creativity they were expressing their was miles above what they were working on a lot of the ways when we do Intervention when we talk about fishing schools talk about test scores a lot of it ends up talking down to our students through our instructions through our intervention that's one of the biggest problems that we need to look at the letters program is very helpful but we do need to be doing a lot more thank you Mr 3 Hill

[00:49:00]
I believe that it is needing to start with the Early Childhood as well that's where kids get their bases from and if they have a good base they you know more than likely they can and they continue with it they'll continue to grow in their proficiency again I don't think this is fully an APS problem especially in District 1 again this is could be helped out by the state again another one of senator's Department I think APS can get a lot of help from from that department and to help the families out as well because in early childhood the families are are you know affect the kid very very much so that's definitely one thing and as well Community Schools thank you

[00:50:00]
one of the biggest barriers that we faced during covid was online learning many of our younger students did not get an adequate education because of online learning they didn't know how to use a laptop or a tablet or anything like that my sister who was a freshman in high school did not attend most of her classes because the teacher wouldn't show up so we have to address that first is that we have a huge gap in learning and education that these students are facing that we have yet to come back from some ways that I do see that we can try to solve some of these issues are not teaching to the test not putting so much pressure on our teachers and students to do these state and federal mandated testing when we're barely teaching students how to write their names right let's meet them where they're at in the inside their classrooms another thing is we need smaller classroom sizes we need to make sure that there are individualized attention to that student so that they get the necessary education that they need in order to

[00:51:00]
low proficiency so we need change in the aps system we have to focus on improving the outcomes so that we can improve their scores we should be helping the families regain you know trust in APS and discuss how the implementation of are merging strategic plan is exciting and necessary in order to get APS back on track and bring up the proficiency of our children standardized test scores

[00:52:00]
I think that's in order to address this we really need to teach our children how to read if we don't address literacy proficiency and they can't read they can't learn anything else it is so important I think that the goals go one early literacy and go to math proficiency are a good step in the or a step in the right direction as well as the interim goals and I highly recommend you read those if you have not but honestly if our children cannot read then they can't learn and so that is really where we need to put our Focus first all right so we're going to move to our next question you're going to start us out I'm going to actually ask the timekeepers we're going to this will be a one and a half minute up to one and a half minutes to respond it's a little bit longer questions so I'm going to read it probably two times just so you are clear on with the question is two parts so what institutional policies and outcomes for students do you believe

[00:53:00]
predict improvements in quality of life and career vocational Choice as adults and the second part of the question is what changes do you see necessary in the district to improve these conditions for our graduates and read it one more time what institutional policies and outcomes for students do you believe predict improvements in quality of life and career vocational Choice as adults what changes do you see necessary in the district to improve these conditions for our graduates it's going to have one and a half minutes okay so when it comes to basically policies and outcomes that will really be predictive of how a child will do as they as they grow as they grow up

[00:54:00]
is focusing and I wish I knew exactly how we could do it but like I said earlier we are all really good at something so the way to focus on what something going to be that's going to be predictive of how a child will do as a grown up is finding what they're good at and I know they do that really well a lot and when you get to college but there has to be a way to do it as a younger as when the children are much younger so some of the changes that we'd have to do is we'd have to increase choices and offerings at schools we have to figure out a way to to bring in the community industry certifications add more stem schools more magnet schools at cetera and find a way to focus every High School on a career like on a career because we every school can't do everything so if we try to do it that way and really open up the choice so if a child is interested in a certain career path that school

[00:55:00]
the high school might be the place they need to go so it's opening up Choice as far as choosing a school based on a career and we have to figure out a way to bring make it much easier for somebody who is in a career or has a tray to become a teacher as long as we don't have that it's going to be difficult to do is to 90 seconds are policies many times for kids especially when there's a career option is not strong enough I think that as I sit and again I'm going to bring up our IEPs and and transition plans the inadequate sea of not following through on those plans and making sure that children have opportunities and options for one thing within special education we have three diplomas and one of them is career

[00:56:00]
there is a curriculum intended we did have it in a majority of our high schools and now we've taken probably only one school that has that program but it's also one of the things that are we going to one because of policy but are we going to also create those opportunities because they are in our hands we can do that but I feel that many times we are so academically focused that we've lost sight of those other children that want to choose the option of career I want to go go into auto mechanics I want to be in carpentry we have not given those opportunities because we so focused on post-secondary education and the lack of that many children are not giving those opportunities and I'm only stating that because I see it continuously within our IEP process and the women over transition plans for all of our kids with disabilities thank you very much

[00:57:00]
what institutional policies and outcomes for students do you believe predict improvements in quality of life and career vocational Choice as adults and what changes do you see necessary in the district to improve these conditions for our graduates okay well when it comes to policy and outcomes the focus needs to be on creativity that is the only way to ensure that students have prepared for the jobs the 21st century that we don't even know exist yet the only way to help them prepare for the incoming climate disasters that are going to happen the unique problems that they're going to have to face you know what are we going to do if we have Haitian immigrants' to Project based learning and to it I really do take

[00:58:00]
this is how we teach English is that if you can't read the English language you're not considered intelligent is a great disservice to our bilingual students or students are just having learning English particularly when it comes to quality of life it is that creativity point it's the Project based learning these are the things that we need to do and having policy that not only reinforces it but requires it is how we move forward 90 seconds so I think again we're on the way to do this the the policies we would have to actually been on our teachers for to see what they would see what they would recommend for their policies

[00:59:00]
again so much diversity would have to have to have different policies set to where the the teachers can allow the kids to explore to see what they're good at but definitely my second biggest stance that I'm running with besides getting parent involvement is getting the getting Union and apprenticeship programs to the schools I graduated Rio Grande High School with honors and auto mechanics it was great to be able to you know go through auto mechanics go through Metals Woods all that different stuff and all that's been taken away from the kids right now they're definitely needs to be more options and just to continue to let our kids thrive

[01:00:00]
tell you their biggest dream and what we need to do is focus on those dreams for those students right how do they understand themselves and their identity because when we understand who we are and our identity and where we come from we're able to really predict where we want to go in the future so policies that I would like to support our ethnic studies and more cultural classes to learn about our history and learn about who we are so that we might get a sense of community within our schools within our district within our community right within the streets that we walk after schools because that's when we come together and we want to build a better future for Our Generations to come so with that not only do we do we do need trade programs in our schools we need to make sure that there are different avenues for post-graduation but if we do that and don't have any other aspect of identity or culture or ownership of our school in our community then those programs will also fall short so really understanding and meeting the students were their

[01:01:00]
and teachers having spaces for them to come together and talk about issues that they care about and how they want to see their community and their school flourishes very important to the quality of improvement that we need to predict thank you Mr Taco 90 seconds I think decreasing class sizes and having the teachers spend more time with the children to identify their different needs some children may want to go to college some may want to go into the technical field we have to be able to help them identify that in order to in order to facilitate that period

[01:02:00]
training smaller classes though I think it would be a really good idea for all the teachers to spend more time with them thank you Miss benavidez understand that they are valued and that they can do what they want to do and it's up to us to guide them if they want to go into carpentry they want to be an electrician if they want to be a plumber we need to honor that and we need to encourage that if they want to go to college we need to honor that and encourage that and I think we need to start when they're young and start talking to them about what they're going to do as they grow up and we can do it in age appropriate ways give them this education and Elementary School be creative it's like that expand on it in Middle School really drive it home

[01:03:00]
there is a path for them and that the school the teachers the community is here to help them Reach that goal that they set for themselves I think it's the best way to go all right you have the last word on this question 97 seconds speaking policies and institutions just one thing I'd like to see from APS is to follow the law I'm talking about the hierarchy in February are former number three with the district is going under Federal grand jury caught by the FBI stealing in between 5.1 and 5.9 million Cheryl Stapleton Williams that was the former number three of APs she made a lot of policy a lot of the policy in place in education is still from Hannah skandera the least popular person

[01:04:00]
her policies are still running the show last year and this year and every year we've been through a lot together in the pandemic teachers but we are supposed to get our written contracts 10 days before the start of the school year so we can agree or disagree to the job at hand they start moving teachers to new schools last year they changed from 26 to 24 paychecks without telling us and the law says New Mexico statute 108.23 written contracts between local school boards and certified instructors shall be executed by the parties not later than 10 days before the first day of the school year 8667 we started August 5th this year we started July 21st they didn't even agreed to a tentative contract until July 26th

[01:05:00]
illegal all right we will be on the next question with MS tomaro and this will be a 1 minute question I'm going back to 1 minute APS is one of the largest landowners in Bernalillo County it has over 150 I'm sorry 140 schools and a student population that is 20,000 lower from its peak about 20 years ago what are your thoughts on consolidating or closing schools and addressing the capital and maintenance costs of APs District 2 in itself is really hurting when it comes to creating more schools because we're in overload we need teachers are sounding alarm but nobody's listening we are closing various schools within the district based on magnet based on

[01:06:00]
the Diversified of overall parents from various parts of the city but we're not really listening to the communities and I think that voice needs to be very loud and clear to some of the strengths that occurring in our communities but then with with our policies we just go ahead and close and shut without the disregard of what those families need and I think we need times we're not sitting down and negotiating and listening to the concerns of the community and listening to the concerns of the parents and also finding out do these students have to be busted if we close a school thank you but to the point one thing that I found interesting I was looking at some students statistics last night specifically on population in the past three years High School population

[01:07:00]
Elementary and Middle School have dropped off significantly and so I think the idea of tying population to enrollment is a very poor decision especially with closing the schools I think what is actually happening is that parents are much more deciding to homeschool their students send them to private school or send them to non-state Charter Schools and then transition them back into APS once they hit High School there's only real thing that I can see that is happening and a lot of that is because we are not offering a system worth investing in quite frankly these are questions that need to be looked in very specifically because it's not necessarily that there aren't enough kids out there to sustain the budget the per capita budget that we have at the schools to keep them open it's probably more so that we're not investing in them enough and doing the opposite has the opposite effect thank you mister 3 yes I think we need to get our community involved again go back to our community reach out to them and see what their

[01:08:00]
main concerns are see how we can fulfill their concerns that way first of all we we keep the students that we have and then we start building upon those students but without without going to the individual communities and and addressing their concerns making them feel that they have a voice make them feel that they're heard we're just APS is just going to continue to lose students thank you thank you one of the schools in my district and now it's completely thriving because of new policies that were put in place at the school by the school one of the greatest ptas that we have is at Lowe's so it's really amazing to have this model when we talked about schools that are needing to be closed or schools that are not doing well don't have enrollment is a great

[01:09:00]
world to see what they did their how they interacted with Community parents and students to bring them back in to the elementary school and one of those things is providing resources for Community making sure that APS and our schools have resources and programs that the magnet were charter schools around the area have because that's what we're losing our students and teachers to write as all of these programs so not only do we need that Community input but we need the funding and the policies and implementation to back that up thank you Mr chuckle there's been way too much waste at APS we need more Community involvement as some of the others said we need to make sure that what the community needs is where we're focusing all of our old bar money time and energy we need more qualified teachers

[01:10:00]
manly schools the pandemic was really harsh not only on the teachers on the children but families as well many people including myself pulled my child out to have them home school during that that particular period of time because they're just wasn't any good interaction over a zoom call for a child to really learn anything so I think we need to reassess that the district is big and I think that played has been around since the late 1800s I respect that I deeply respect that I think consolidating and closing schools needs to be an absolute Last Resort and I think that what we need to do is review the 2.2 billion dollar budget to find

[01:11:00]
gentrifying the North Valley right now closing time talk about closing Garfield MacArthur Duran is a long-standing schools you hear what happened with Los Padilla's when you just changed some policies how you can turn it around largely Hispanic Spanish-speaking communities that you're closing period they're actually creating lower income housing for

[01:12:00]
they got nowhere to live it's very hard to find a home right now thank you Miss Mueller Aragon thank you so right now Santa Fe is telling all the school districts that they need to figure out how to write size that is just something that's happening not just here in New Mexico it's happening across across the United States we need to do when it comes to write sizing is listen to to those who understand understand growth we already have a Community Capital advisory committee who can make recommendations to the board we need to use those experts better than what we've done and if that means that we figure out how to make schools like Los Padres more inviting and that's something that perhaps that Community Capital advisory committee would recommend we need to listen to them

[01:13:00]
we have to listen to the local community and perhaps something that we should do is maybe focus on some of those schools that are really low enrollment and use them for internships bring a lot of those you know Industries into the schools make it a school of choice for those kids and focus on certain traits thank you so our next question Mr Coker you'll have the first opportunity to respond question is if you are elected you will be involved in selecting a new superintendent what criteria do you have for the new superintendent this is a question so I this is kind of twofold I remember and was there when we were doing those Community you know put in your vote for for the qualities you want to superintendent to have which were in the trash somewhere I'm sure I've got to dig out but that is what I would base it on me personally

[01:14:00]
just based off of my community I know a lot of people that would be very well suited in particular regardless of the way that this election goes I do think that Janelle would actually be a very good option that is just my personal opinion but there's so many people out there who would do a very good job at this we just they're already in our community we don't really need to be Outsourcing or doing the good old boy tactic that we've done with Scott elder sister I believe that we would need to definitely find somebody local somebody that understands the families the community because that's that's the greatest concern that's where we're lacking right now with APS and we need again need to get the communities more involved and to get the parents involved in if there's a superintendent that knows the that knows

[01:15:00]
the circumstances that each family is bringing their child to school with I think that will go a long long way thank you for that I think the superintendent should have one is I agree with Robert they have to understand the culture of our district they have to understand where our students are coming from and the resources that they need when they're at school another thing is we have over 80 Community Schools right now and if the superintendent that we select does not understand what that means for our district then they will end up being failing schools so that has to be a top priority another is understanding a budget as I'm sure that it's probably the number one criteria for a superintendent but we are getting or we all have this overflow of money and depending on where the superintendent can Implement those policies and that funds is super important so I'll be looking out

[01:16:00]
proven success and experience in a district similar to aps's a leader who understands the importance of accountability and aligns with students outcomes focused governance a leader who is motivated about making a difference and is willing to make both changes and that will collaborate with the board and the community in order to serve our families and our children thank you you know when they're interviewing they say all the right things but we need somebody who's going to not just talk but

[01:17:00]
the superintendent will not allow that they will not allow the district to operate within equitable distribution of school or Community Based Services the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated and equitably the superintendent will not allow curriculum and instruction that is not district and standards the line if the superintendent we choose is not going to follow that then that's not the superintendent for APS Mister yeah so in January we're going to hire a new superintendent and in the last 10 years we've just seen a revolving door of superintendents every year and a half every two years some cases every six weeks with Louise and he ended up paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars just to walk away and we need someone that's going to be committed to the Long Haul

[01:18:00]
in this District someone with the actual 5 year plan not a I'm using this as a stepping stone for my political career and I'm going to move to be an educational consultant Silicon Valley these kinds of things and I just want to throw one name out there that got he got overlooked and somehow you guys picked Scott Helder over Dr Richard Bowman but he's the real hero of the pandemic he's the one that did the technology distribution the other night when elder was saying that we're going to just hire random people to be put in the classroom he's the only one that shook his head no that's you were just on board with it thank you so when it comes to selecting and you superintendent and we have to have somebody who really is a true leader because it's a true leader is somebody who's going to make changes and who's going to make things better we have to put somebody who is successful in improving student outcomes with districts that have similar demographics to APS we have to have someone who

[01:19:00]
is somebody who believes in listening who believes in engaging and listening to the community who believes in building relationships we have to have somebody who can speak to the corner of our student population that speaks another language besides English we have to have someone who cares about the refugee Community because they are often left out and they are often silence and I think that is very imperative we also have to have somebody who understands a budget we when I started on the board we had a 1.3 billion dollar budget now we have a 2.3 billion dollar budget somebody has to know how to budget based on need and that is where we are headed right now thank you we have discredited so much by the mispronunciation the fact that were included in the golden

[01:20:00]
the other area would be to hire here understanding the culture and languages and the various vast tribes that have existed throughout Albuquerque and also those connections to tribes in the relationships longevity communication I would love communication skills and connecting with Community I would love a Spanish-speaking superintendent and would love to know that we there's an understanding of community and the connection of community and how do we get out there to increase the value of our community with voices and the parents that need to be part of this huge Community we have that's one thing we're really liking so I'm hoping that we can really get somebody who understands all right we're going to move to our next question what is your understanding of the lawsuit and how will you support the district's efforts to make the changes required

[01:21:00]
so with the Martinez Yazzie I've worked very closely with the former APS board member and in a sense the Yazi part of the Martinez Jazzy lawsuit on Dolores griego very closely and we've went around serving students to try to see how to better how to better elaborate with them and with the families to to understand their lacks they're getting an education aspects to that but again it's bringing Community bringing Community into it getting parents involved and getting them all to understand the the differences in the in the child's

[01:22:00]
learning abilities for each different type of child thank you Miss Astoria and my role was to bring students in to have student voice and build recommendations to present to the lawyers that then got presented to the judge some of those recommendations by the students where they wanted more Mental Health Resources they wanted Equitable funding for schools they wanted racial inequities to be addressed inside of APS and they also wanted better training for teachers when it comes to Mental Health crisis when it comes to the lawsuit there's many policies around it it gets thrown around a lot and if you're not understanding that inside the classroom students are facing these inequities all the time then you're not going to understand why it's so important we need more than just policies that name the lawsuit we need actual people to believe in why the lawsuit was created believe in the change and make sure that students and teachers are getting out of the resources to make those

[01:23:00]
so the students have to be listened to they have to as the other said bring that to the judge so that changes can be made because the inequities are they're just they're not very productive they're not in any way helping any of the students so unless we can recognize that and we can bring that to the Forefront and give everybody an equitable chance of falling thank you

[01:24:00]
and to say that this is a problem is is an understatement and I think that it was a wake-up call to assault it's not going to be fixed overnight and I think some progress has been made kids are somewhat better off now than they were a decade ago but there's more work to be done and obviously it needs to be done at the school level but this is a problem for the community and it takes a village as we all know and we need to get our other agencies involved CYFD public education department of health to address this holistically is there another opso in 20304

[01:25:00]
Tracy movie discrimination I'm just reminding everybody that we are a bilingual district and Yazzie Martinez says 5 years ago that APS is failing our Hispanic speakers are native speakers and all economically disadvantaged students yet at my school we have a Spanish teacher and a Navajo teacher is so cool my school actually teaches Navajo I love it I encouraged so many kids to take it and they don't pay them the bilingual stipend my wife is now ailing will records because they didn't pay her the Bible teacher for APS one year didn't pay me the Bible why if he has a Martinez is saying that you have to have money is not an excuse it says thank you thank you so as Mr Nogales said we have a constitution that recognizes two language in Spanish is Spanish is one of them

[01:26:00]
when this decision was finally made they did not they were not specific about how much was supposed to be targeted toward these groups but the legislature can do that and with his surplus of 3 billion dollars they can tell us in earmark a lot of that money towards that demographic the Aussie Martinez demographic when we're looking at our goals it's what our goal one and our goal to go to are all about we are all going to be headed towards student based budgeting hopefully by 2026 it will all our budgeting will be based on student needs and we know that this group deserves a great education and we know that they have not received one so we need to make sure that we are doing more and that we are bringing in Educators who understand understand this group we don't do a very good job about it and I hope we get better thank you mister

[01:27:00]
we have to recognize that 40% of our student population fits in the criteria of e l l and children with disabilities my opponent next to me disregarded that this particular lawsuit was not only racist but that it was not going to serve all kids but when they have a high rate of population with our students who fit into these categories so top-heavy the for the five years the money has not filtered down to our children I've worked on legislation I've worked on the special ed Department I've done all of those things to help and do what's needed but I still see what's very salty is we got administrators we got directors and we got legislators even for misguided by how this lawsuit needs to work so first and foremost let's call it Martinez and Yazzie

[01:28:00]
lawsuit thank you but one thing I do want to sort of emphasize is that it does include special education students that often goes overlooked and I think it's it's kind of it's such a surreal moment to have to have a lawsuit to see what's been happening right in front of our faces even address it to look at it to at least somewhat cut passed all of the the almost Mastery you know something congratulations that we do as special at these board meetings in order to adequately address these things the what we need to do is have an actual pedagogical overhaul because it's not just students color that is affected by this we like to act like this diversity means that we have to teach these students differently ignoring their Humanity in that it's creativity learning 21st Century Learning that I said it's been working for Thousand Years for indigenous people that works for everybody is a human process that's how we get through these things and again this is

[01:29:00]
something that shouldn't need a lawsuit it is shameful that we have to quote it in all our policies just to feel better about ourselves all right we're going to move to our next question is how would you propose to stabilize and support District Improvement initiatives such as the district's new 5 years strategic plan over longer periods of time thank you when it comes to the Strategic plan that is one of the superintendent jobs so hopefully we have a superintendent that is understanding of that plan and can Implement to correctly the way that Community likes or wants that implemented one of the things that I will just point out real quickly since I have the mic when it comes to the Strategic plan is that restorative justice and Youth Boys was not going to be designed until 2024 2025 which for me that shows us exactly where our mindset is for students and where they are in the district so

[01:30:00]
it comes to those policies I would really love to rethink them if I am on the board and be able to bring some of those things forward as an overarching theme and not just a thing that can be designed and implemented there are many other ways that we can provide the master plan throughout the district and that is looking at individual schools and seeing what is needed directly for that school and implementing those things first so making it kind of a where you're at type of basis and not an overall thank you Mr chuckle my implementing the Strategic plan we've set up foundation so we have outcomes that are set we're going to do it over five years after the five years or during those five years you check and see where you are you Monitor and then you start to adjust and you start to make

[01:31:00]
the plan for the following 5 years so that you're able to keep moving forward as opposed to stagnating so that's how that's how I see it doing the best job is to be able to continuously Monitor and make adjustments thank you Miss benavidez certainly how would you propose to stabilize and support District Improvement initiatives such as the district's new 5 year strategic plan over longer periods of time I like the goals and guardrails and one of the reasons I like them is because the community had a lot of say and in how they were developed and I think that's important they spoke to teachers and parents and

[01:32:00]
and none of this is going to work because our schools are our communities and I think that the way to make sure that we are hitting goal one two three and four is by hiring a superintendent who is going to adhere to the guard rails and periodically checked to make sure that we are meeting those milestones and if we're not then we're going to have to readjust to make sure we do and we need to change and it's okay to do that we all have to be open-minded thank you mister Palace and guardrails Martinez Martinez Martinez Jazzy seems to be a big topic of conversation yet you look at my school they're not paying the Navajo and the Spanish teachers from going to say Arizona or Colorado where they would pay that bill stipend or Texas

[01:33:00]
but I don't see anything in the Recruitment and Retention of teachers were missing 700 to 1,000 teachers in this District 300 educational assistant positions available right now those are really teacher positions they're trying to get educational assistance to do the job for half price we need to recruit and retain teachers or none of these goals are possible without a physical body in the classroom teaching the kindergartener how to read thank you it's not going away it's going to be here for the next five years and we are going we have our goals we have our guard rails we know where we're headed so the thing that's the most important right now is we know we need to figure out how we're going to find it so we have to

[01:34:00]
we have to get the funds to keep to keep this going we're going to be losing a lot of our federal funds that we've used for you know a lot of this this demographic so we need to make sure that we asked the legislature to fund to fund our kids they deserve to be funded we have to also make sure that we're bringing in our Community Partners to help because we can't do this alone we need everybody to Rally around our kids thank you very much you need to communicate with those are not only two teachers to parents and to the community I think one thing that needs to be stipulated when we look at literacy and math goals is to include our children's IEPs and the disability range for their goals also should be to address literacy and make sure that they can read and write

[01:35:00]
4 we need to also state that transition plans are very viable and that they are going to work and they are going to meet the needs of our children many of them are grandioso and they are only used to create a nice little picture of what's going on with our kids with disabilities but my thing is if we don't communicate we don't educate and we don't involve parents and we don't make sure that everyone is aware of what these are we're not going to go anywhere and then also the needs of the teachers need to be met and we need to hire just as I agree with Mrs we are not doing the basics for this Foundation to work how would you propose to stabilize and support District Improvement initiatives such as the district's strategic plan over longer period

[01:36:00]
to me that absolutely nothing in here is about like teacher support you know what I'm looking at the actual pedagogical shift that we need the training that we need the the reinvestment in our infrastructure there's the goals in here are so hurtful and small that like for special needs students for example if you would go up from 12 to 22 percent sure that's better than it was we're still abandoning the other three students out of four that aren't proficient you know why are we aiming so low for ourselves and would I find particularly shameful about this is that it's what I know is going to happen and why they're so low is that these are relatively feasible and as soon as we get there a lot of board members are going to be using this as a bulk against actual Improvement when you can't really criticize us we've met our goals and guardrails that you agree to that you like you know why are you criticizing us this happens every time we do anything thank you mister 332 so with this I do like the golden rules

[01:37:00]
this was brought to us by the community I was actually I sat in to help establish these goals and guardrails with the input of of many many community members especially in District when I believe that was the biggest turnout for the community input sessions so listening to the community and seeing what we can what we can improve on is was the first step now to continue it is to hold the district accountable as a board member mean I would hold the district to accountable to make sure that these goals and guards are being met and to continue to support the teachers as well see what what they need from their side to make these more feasible and continue to build upon them but not to hold them as a set standard so like within the next five years yes build upon them thank you I think we are

[01:38:00]
the question is what will you do to keep our kids safe at school that's an excellent question I spoke to a few former teachers over the past couple weekends that have left APS because of the violence and all of the safety issues that were facing it seems to me that in order to make kids safe we need to be able to funnel them through one place where they can check to make sure there's no weapons fencing up around the building's I don't know medical detectors having extra security on campus Because if the kids aren't safe

[01:39:00]
my daughter wasn't going to get shot at school and when she went back then I became afraid again I think that there's a lot we can do I think that we can research security on campus ensuring that the guards are there for the purpose of protecting the students and not badgering them especially our students of color who are in Northern Illinois affected by police officers or resource officers I think that we need to be really careful the message we're sending to our students do we want our schools to look like prisons or do we want them to be educational institutions I think there's a lot we can do there and we also need to teach our children conflict resolution so it doesn't escalate

[01:40:00]
where are the police at the school on The Daily they're not there so let me know that we lack police officers with the district you can go and find armed security at any Box store in town but our schools like you don't want to don't want the kids to be triggered by police with guns certified law enforcement in the schools school resource officers if a school has a population of over 500 there needs to be a police in that school every day at least making rounds why don't we invite some cops to the schools for lunch their hungry you know that we need to think outside the box and get the police

[01:41:00]
to the schools and get other members the only one that's doing anything to share of John Allen he's the only one sending his deputies to Atrisco right now thank you Miss Mueller Aragon so keeping something that none of us disagree with so some of the things that we can do are increasing our APS police force there should be a police officer at every school not just a high schools that every school we have to have relationships at the school level so children have someone they trust that they can go to instead of just instead of acting maybe they could go and they can have somebody to talk to we have to complete the last phases of the secured vegetables we have to make sure fencing is completed that all our cameras are working order in working order and we have to make sure there are enough Duty teachers that we find there isn't right now to watch over our treasure kids with a bell that's causing lots of problems

[01:42:00]
and we should expand the curriculum pilot on gun violence on gun violence from just two high schools and two middle schools to every school thank you first and foremost we need to strongly look at our school to prison Pipeline and what we're creating we have huge numbers to I think that we have a tendency to punish more than we are willing to restore use restorative justice practices I think that oftentimes we more react to the fear then we do in real life we have a tendency to think that these are adults producing these behaviors and many of these children are have disabilities and our mistreated have a great cross guard in Volcano Vista and works with

[01:43:00]
he takes his bike after all the kids have gone into class and he circles that school and the Elementary in the Middle School to check for safety if there's any concerning calls but thank you Mr Coker can you repeat the question please what will you do to keep our kids safe at school okay so when it comes to gun violence the person I would defer to Janelle and you all should very much listen to her when she speaks but I want to talk about school safety very specifically the difference between safety and control I believe disagree with adding police to schools because what happens is to someone like me 64 with this skin tone is I get shot that is just what happened with my Demeter and how my own sense of justice I would not put up with abuse that the police and looked on people that was happening right now even with our school security officers they're throwing our kids around they are bullying them and sure they're friends with some of them sure but that's not worth the violence they inflict it's not

[01:44:00]
out more control of the students we need to start actually asking ourselves what are we keeping them safe from safe from each other safe from their teachers in reality the lot of the school shootings are from in cell white supremacist outside of the school that's the social problem that we need to be looking at not over policing schools not criminalizing our students thank you mister yes I would definitely want to see more resource officers in this school but also more education more going to education just like a couple of board members said there is a program that the City of Albuquerque puts on that educates students on gun violence and to see that first to let the students know most of these students are giving guns or get guns from the first from friends without really knowing the impact that even carrying a gun much less using

[01:45:00]
bring a gun has to everybody around them so that would be that would be the first thing that I would do and after that just more Community involvement to just to show that you know the community cares and the community standing behind the school in situations in situations like that thank you and I was fortunate enough to meet with 160 middle school students last Friday and we talked about safety some of the students that were there from Polk Middle School where many many students were sent to the principal's office for carrying guns on campus and when speaking with them even though they had a fear of these mass shootings that were happening every single one of them said that more police on campus and metal detectors will make them

[01:46:00]
preventive measures such as mediation and meditation rooms martial arts in their classroom so that students can understand how to really focus on their emotions how to talk with their peers when there's disagreements students want these types of training and skills because it's not only going to help them now but it'll help them post-graduation we should be focusing on those types of skills that students will have throughout their lives and not making them feel like they have fear every time they walk into their classroom thank you all right so we are going to be going to our last question before your closing comments this is gone very fast so it's been obvious you're going to get us started the question is in many states school boards are dictating what teachers can teach and what materials are available to students in classrooms and school libraries what is your opinion on those efforts I think what you're really talking

[01:47:00]
I think that the people who want to do this forget two of the many wonderful traits that we see in our children and that is how curious they are and how rebellious they are and I can tell you that when I was younger but book was banned that's the book I was looking for because that's the information they need and they're getting that information from other sources it has nothing to do with what they're learning in school or the books that they're reading that is not where they're getting the information that people think they shouldn't have that is to teach them how to become critical thinkers the information that they're receiving through the internet or through their phones that's their parents responsibility what's being taught in schools is necessary for them to succeed in life period thank you mister novels yes so in 2022 the state of Tennessee banned the book Mouse Google

[01:48:00]
carry me a whole box full of them for my classroom in the future I don't really like book bands however I had a pretty radical teacher that was in my classroom a language arts teacher before me she got fired from the school for just being a bozo and I went through her catalog of books and I found some books that looked kind of Elementary look like but that's some pretty sexual content in their nature and I would have loved to bring them here and read from me like they do in all those culture War school board meetings across the country however I just throw them away because they were trash and there's no business for them to be anywhere near a school my library did not put that there that was this road teacher that's and he looked at the school board district is headed towards allowing unlicensed people into the classroom so we really do need to have a nice balance of what goes on the Shelfs thank you so with our guard rails we are ensuring that

[01:49:00]
call parents and all Community are going to be engaged and have a say in every important decision as a teacher I read many books every day kids brought books from home that I read we checked out library books we did reading out loud reading to ourselves kids chose our favorite books we had nightly reading at home and All Families got to choose those but in order to even be able to get to read books we have to have more than 30% of our children who are able to read at grade level So reading books should be our start because we have to be able to read for them to even be able to pick up a book and read it thank you that we meet the needs of kids from all areas

[01:50:00]
Banning in itself I don't approve of I just had a great friend who's an author in need of American Author have her book been called you know and it always talked about was the relocation of Native Americans giving history and she herself couldn't figure out why it was banned I strongly think that I'm an Avid Reader my kids were Avid readers and I think that any time you pursue or direct those the contexts we disregard and we take away from critical thinking we take away from the enthusiasm to want to learn and find out on a subject matter that nobody's talking about that we can increase the the motivation to want to be in a decision and I want our children to learn and thank you Mr Coker as always and what materials are available to students in class

[01:51:00]
what is your opinion on those efforts okay yeah so it's well in terms of instructional materials we actually do have a lot of really dumb and bad instructional materials that talks down to our students but that's never what this conversation is about this conversation is always about things that help students either with their own body autonomy understanding consent or understanding when they're being sexually abused at a young age this is usually what is tried to get out of schools by these groups or they try to get books that reflect the experiences of minorities out of these books out of schools and all of these arms students and their safety when it comes to book Banning I it's it's become such a concerted effort that I fully believe that there is a policy that in place that can filter a lot of these requests out you know but that's simply my solution and to be very specific I wholeheartedly believe that we need to start looking at that fear of having

[01:52:00]
materials in front of students channeled into what that actually means because anything can be sexually explicit if you want to teach a child about common water sexually active or something you should be doing that is sexually explicit but it is still beneficial thank you mister Trujillo yes so I'm in a full support of the of the policies that APS currently has which you know allows the Librarians to to choose which which books they have is and also with the resources for the teachers I would never hold back any resources from a teacher that a teacher would need to have their students fully engaged in any kind of learning thank you today because of those types of classes

[01:53:00]
those types of books those types of critical thinking that is what led me to focus on student voice and dedicate my life to ensuring that students within Albuquerque Public Schools have a right to sit at the table or write to understand who and where they come from and how that's going to help them in the future those books are not harmful that curriculum is not harmful it is actually very helpful because for someone like me who comes from San Jose Barrio where there's a lot of gang and drug activity who that's the word that's the norm to learn about how resilient my ancestors are to learn how beautiful my languages and to be validated that is why I'm here so I'm getting emotional but thank you to those teachers who will stand up who have gone fired who have gone and pushed out of schools because they're doing the right thing for their students thank you mister chuckle did you repeat the question please certainly in many states school boards are dictating what teachers can teach and

[01:54:00]
what materials are available to students in classrooms and in school libraries what is your opinion on those efforts I think there needs to be some kind of stop gaps there's the kids need to be able to express themselves the teachers should have some flexibility and what they're teaching so if we don't allow that to happen then we're hurting the children or the families but I think the community should have some input into that as well and I think with the goals and guidelines that are are being introduced that they have listened to the community and I think that's the way

[01:55:00]
that it should continue if the community is not involved in making some of those decisions then we're failing everybody all right nice job candidates answering those questions we are at the very end we have time for closing statements so we'll do big round of applause once we get through our closing statements this will be 30 second closing statement and Mr Nogales you will start us off yeah I decided to run we declared on August 29th I just decided to run when I saw that both these were raising money since February and in Rolanda's questionnaire they say describe your experience volunteering for the community and doors schools answer blank nothing you're not in the schools and Peggy you're a West Mason so long and you have continued to ignore that school through four shootings and two guns found this year and you didn't even want to talk about it on your questionnaire so I'm here my students go to West Mesa when they're done

[01:56:00]
can I represent all their voices thank you Miss Miller Auto on 30th I won't I won't attack so it's it's time again to make a choice about what's going to just be best for kids and ensure that we have a board that's just going to be fully committed to our students first to improving student outcomes and to holding everybody accountable for moving the needle for our for our children to also embracing all the reforms and all the goals that we need to meet in the next five years restaurant they are our greatest asset and they make our board proud every day so gracias por Veneta and when you vote please vote for somebody who's going to always put kids first thank you for 30 seconds and

[01:57:00]
declaring that she is going to do what's right when in fact she does counter I I am running for district 2 APS school board I want to restore balance back into our schools we have at the moment not really seriously looked at the inadequacies of what this district is doing but yeah we want to create the pluses thank you all right thank you District 2 candidates let's move to district one for closing statements thank you I really want all of you in the audience and you at home to start expecting more from your board members right now there's not really a lot of options even on this Kansas City Board to really push yourself forward to it is just about maintaining status quo or playing defense and we need actual Vision in the district thank you mister through here 30 seconds so I'm here for my community I've grown up in my community

[01:58:00]
going up with the teachers I've grown up with the students I'm going to put the parents all in my community I don't have enough time here to list all the different organizations that I've been a part of in my community but that is one reason why I am the only candidate in District 1 that is supported by all the teachers are all the educator unions the CLC and most all of our elected officials in that District because they know me thank you thank you I am very proud to be the youngest and my vision for APS has always been the same it is put students first put teachers first I have been passionately working for this since I was 13 years old and I will not stop even if I am not elected I will be happy to work with Community to ensure that our voices are heard but if you would like to learn more my platform is on my website and it is created by students for students

[01:59:00]
you have 30 seconds just want to thank you and APS for putting this on I appreciate the opportunity I've been working in the community Title One homeless project feed New Mexico kids and I want to now take that to another level so with keeping the focus on the importance of kids and outcomes and not politics I think that I would like to move forward with that thank you so much I'm hearing a lot of complaints complaints are fine complaints with Solutions are better and I'm running to serve District 4 because I am passionate

[02:00:00]
that's going to harm our lgbtqia students I trust our Educators and we'll make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs our children have a right to a public education where they learn and grow in a safe environment and one that prepares them for college or a career when they graduate I'm here to protect that right thank you all right let's give our candidates a big round of applause so on behalf of Albuquerque Public Schools in my own organizations with Community Schools I want to thank all of our candidates for your participation in tonight's forum and for your participation in our Democratic process it's at the local level that our democracy really begins and I want to thank the volunteers and our audience for your participation in tonight's forum and a reminder early voting starts October 10th and election day is November 7th
