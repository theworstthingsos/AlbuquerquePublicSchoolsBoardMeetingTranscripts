Trimble go ahead thank you madam chairman of the board superintendent Dr Blakey today's meeting is the entrance conference for the 2023 2024 audit every agency in governmental entity has to be audited every year per state law APS is required to choose a new auditor at least every 8 years and is required to follow the request for proposal process every four years the 2023 2024 years of final year with moss Adams under the current 4 year contract New Mexico statue requires monthly updates to the audit committee during the audit field work process which is usually scheduled during the fourth week of every month is normally held at the end of October General audit status information will be shared during the Open session in closed meeting

[00:07:00]
in the open session of the meeting but any issues findings and details will only be shared in the closed meetings as required by the state audit rule all information shared in closed sessions must remain confidential until after the audit is released by the state otters office usually in December or January only after the that approval from the state auditor can the Board of Education discuss the audit in an open meeting at least the document the auto document is about 1000 pages and there are links on the aps website to the State website for the more recent APS audits the aps audit includes District Charter Schools all the documents are heavily regulated Sheila Herrera she is the

[00:08:00]
how did engagement partner in lead with moss Adams in game master terminal good afternoon or members members of the audit committee superintendent again my name is Sheila headed up I am a partner here with moss Adams and so we are on our final year to complete the audit of Albuquerque Public School District along with all of the component units which includes all of the charter schools and Albuquerque Public School foundation and so we are required to do an entrance conference under the New Mexico State partner ultimately in charge of signing of all of the reports that get issued the district itself is Mark mentioned has a thousand Pages if anyone is interested in looking at that and then we do have some stand-alones that get issued at the charter school level as well as Albuquerque Public School

[00:09:00]
play Foundation has its own financial statements we do have a QC reviewer at the district level and so the QC Reviewer is responsible for making sure that we've met all of the aicpa audit requirements along with all of our Internal Documentation requirements along with making sure that the financial statements are complete all the disclosures make sense and there's nothing that is significant missing from the reports we do have a senior manager that will be leading the audit this year and has been consistent for the last few years that we've done the district audit and that is sujan we do have a new manager her name is Jody and she will be in charge of both the financial statements side and the single audit for the federal compliance that we have to do and then we do have an audit senior this year that will also be in the field on site working with Mark and his team as we move through the audit process here

[00:10:00]
so as part of the audit we are engaged to complete the annual financial statement audit for the year ending June 30th 2024 and we are required to communicate the Nana test Services here under the yellow book standards and so we do assist management with the preparation of the notes to the financial statements particularly around the charter schools and the Albuquerque Public School Foundation disclosures that go into the district financial statements we also assist with the preparation of the schedules of the component unit proportionate shares of the pension liability and contributions along with the other post employment benefit liability and contributions there are required supplementary information schedules that go into the financial statements and so anything that is required specifically for the charter schools we are assisting with preparing those we

[00:11:00]
complete all of the combining statements for all the charter schools along with all the appendix information for all of those components as part of the audit process the auditor responsibility is to form an opinion on whether the financial statements are materially correct and so as part of the audit process we have already started working through our planning process for the year we started looking at some of the internal controls we are required to follow the generally accepted auditing standards that are issued by the aicpa the government auditing standards which is the yellow book requirements is another set of rules that we have to follow as the auditor does require us to look at Independence a little bit cheaper than if we were doing just a flat aicpa audio we also have additional continuing education requirements that we have to meet to meet that standard

[00:12:00]
we also have to follow the New Mexico State audit rule as part of this the state auditor does require us to look at things like travel and procurement along the way and so we started to go through some of those state required items as part of our interim process here and so our job is the Auditors I guess it is to make sure that the financial statements are materially correct and so we do calculate materiality based off the level of activity each year that is in each of the funds and then we do look at some of the total funds as one number depending on what that looks like each year and so that does change from here to year as part of our process we also look at the internal controls within the district making sure that we can see for example proper segregation of Duties we can see documentation over policies and procedures that if there's

[00:13:00]
schools that need to happen on certain documentation that we can see that happening and so we don't necessarily provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls but if something does come to our attention along the way we are required to evaluate it to determine whether it rises to the level of what we call either a significant efficiency or a material weakness which is there's errors that could happen with the financial statements if this control is not properly in place and so the state auditor here in New Mexico does require us though even if we find something that is a material they do require us to report that as a finding as an other non-compliance finding stuff you go back into some of the historical financial statements you'll see quite a few other non-compliance finding for the reason that the state auditor does require us to report those and so as Mark noted our job as the Auditors during our

[00:14:00]
play chickens or at the exit conference we are required to communicate any type of findings that we do identify either from the financial statement reporting audit or the compliance audit of the federal warrants and so that'll be reported to you all we do have the the component units like I mentioned that we audit and so this is the Albuquerque Public Schools Foundation we do have 30 charter schools and then of those charter schools there are 11 Foundation that are included in this charter schools that also require an audit so all of these have their own opinions that we do provide within the reports and then some of them have stand-alone reports that get over to the state auditors office as well and so we have started our planning process the planning process does require us to go through a full list

[00:15:00]
what's my related to the risk assessment we're looking for things that have high inherent risk in general and so it requires us to determine whether for our purposes of documentation and how we're going to be able to test certain areas of the financial statements whether they fall into what we call a significant risk and so revenue is typically inherently always a significant risk and so we do quite a bit of work here related to the cash receipts that are received to make sure that those transactions are being properly recorded to the correct general ledger accounts to the correct funds and for the correct amounts and so we also look at the ground Awards to make sure that we can see whatever is being requested for reimbursement that we can see that that is the amount that the district is receiving the States paying that and that you can see that the amount is flowing through each of the funds correctly the district

[00:16:00]
what does operate on a modified Cash basis for the year and so the financial statement process does require management to go through and record all the accruals at the end of the year and so this is a very significant process for the management team and making sure all of those across from receivables to payables to accounts payable reliability for example at the end of the year get recorded into the trial balance system there's a lot of Gatsby specific entries that get paid for things like fixed assets and so all of those entries are one-time entries that get posted each year prior to a starting the audit and so we do a significant amount of work just making sure that there's no potential cut off issues or things that could have been missed because it is a little bit of a manual process to make sure all those girls do

[00:17:00]
inappropriately on the other thing that we do spend a lot of time on is the ibnr and the claims expense there is some lag reports and actuary reports that are received and so just making sure that those estimates for those Reserve calculations are correct and there's no significant potential adjustments that need to be made to those accruals at the end of the year usually we're looking a little bit subsequent to your end just make sure that they're really isn't anything significant sitting out there that hasn't already been estimated for debt we do send confirmation for all the dead accounts the bond issuance any type of refunding typically we're looking at those adjustments for sure and so we want to make sure that those are getting recorded properly in the financial statements there are some different inflows and outflows and amortizations that need to happen

[00:18:00]
for the financial statements to be correct and so we are looking at that as part of the audit process since those are significant dollars and then the last thing is really the compliance with the grant programs the district does receive a significant amount of federal funds that flow through the New Mexico public education department and so we have to go through each year and determine which programs need to be audited and so we do have the SR funds that will be a significant program this year again and then we'll have a special education fund that is the other one and so those rotate typically between the idea be the title one the food distribution a lot of those rotate from here to here because those are the significant programs at the district does receive so we'll have two major programs and maybe a third one depending on where June ends up

[00:19:00]
from the auditor responsibility responsibility related to fraud the audit itself is not necessarily designed to look for fraud we do a full risk assessment at the beginning of the audit process really looking to make sure are there any accounts that we think inherently have a higher fraud risk how do we address this through audit procedures internally we do have team discussions related to how do we make sure we address these things that we see from year to year potentially that I even with other clients how do we you know see if there's anything at the district that we need to be concerned about we do have various fraud interviews with individuals on the management team with the audit committee with the superintendent along the way to make sure that there's nothing that is sitting out there that we're not aware of if

[00:20:00]
play something that is identified through this process we are required to communicate that over to the state auditor's office and then we are required to perform audit procedures to determine how it does impact the financial statements and so the audit timeline we did meet with management back in April just getting an idea of where what has happened during the year already to that point kind of getting a timeline together to make sure that we can meet the state auditor deadline and so we started our interim process going through planning starting our control testing starting to look at some of the single audit planning and then some of those required items that we have to test and so we'll work through that this week as well along with working through the rest of the single audit control documentation and then some of the compliance items that we have to start to get through

[00:21:00]
conference and then we do pick up final field work for the district by the end of September so that we can really finish up our field work by the end of October and then meet that November 15th deadline to the state auditor's office and so everything is completed at that point the state auditor then refused the report I usually takes them a good month and a half to kind of get through that process we get some comments back usually on things that they have questions on potential formatting things that they want corrected and then it usually gets issued by the end of the year in order to meet some of the deadlines for you all to submit the financial statements for compliance and so that's really the process for the district side we for the component units the Albuquerque Public School Foundation

[00:22:00]
start their audit process in August and then all of the charter schools will also start all of that audit process August 1st all of those typically start getting completed by October 15th so that all the information can start getting combined into the district financial statements and so we do have several audit deliverables that we include in the reporting package so in that five volume report we do have the report of independent Auditors on the financial statements and so this includes the opinions of the district itself for all the major funds we have the opinion over the aggregate remaining funds the government wide statements all the opinions for any charter schools that do not have their Standalone report will also be in this report and then we have our report on internal controls and so this is our yellow book report

[00:23:00]
is there a government auditing standards and so this is where if there are any findings specifically related to the financial statements this is where they would be identified and then we have the report on compliance for each major federal program which is our single audit on all those federal funds that you will receive and so if there are any findings this is where those would be included in that report we do have the separate fund separate reports that we do issue for Albuquerque Public School foundation and then about 8 Charter Schools issue stand alone as well and those are required to be submitted to the state auditor ahead of that November 15th July and then the final document once everything is completed by the state auditors office is the data collection form which is the information around the federal funds that goes directly to the feds and so the expectations during the audit process is really making sure

[00:24:00]
that there's limited journal entries after we started our final fieldwork we really need to we've really worked over the last few years to work with management and making sure that we can provide an appropriate schedule so that we've received all of the requested items by the deadline all the adjustments need to be completed at that point so that all the information going into the financial statements is accurate and we can complete our audit process and so there's a lengthy process of closing all the books and records and all of that so far we work with management to make sure that all the time lines if there's anything that needs to be completed at a later point where we're moving the work around as we need to if there's any proposed adjustments our job is to make sure that we've identified those in communicated that with management if there's any control deficiencies management is aware of those and is working either to correct

[00:25:00]
play more to respond to them and then any prior year audit findings we typically start looking at those during our final filled work early on in the process to make sure that either of those have been cleared or if there's any any adjustments to those findings that need to be discussed that we have that conversation early on and so we do have one charter school that we've been informed that will close its doors as of June 30th 2024 and so in a few days that Charter School will close there will no longer be a board at that point and so in the past when this happens The District board will also be receiving an update throughout the audit process for William and Josephine Community Charter School and we will also include them as part of the exit conference for the district as well and

[00:26:00]
the management team of the district will also be responsible for assigning the final representation letter for us but that is all I have is part of the entrance conference are there any questions certificate of excellence in financial reporting from the association of school business officials I just want to thank God

[00:27:00]
I also want to recognize my district controller Amanda boil but she's the lead on audit and she does has done a really good job so I just want to share that with the word thank you sorry I didn't mean to clap it was loud all right then thank you everyone for this presentation and we got a lot going on until the end of the year so I look forward to not only us coming together so that's going to do it right now for this meeting and so our next meeting will be July 23rd 2024 at 5 p.m. and for those who may be watching virtually please watch us on the 8S Board of Education YouTube channel
