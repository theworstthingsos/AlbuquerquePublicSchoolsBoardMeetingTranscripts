we are now streaming go ahead please welcome to the capital outlay property and Technology committee meeting I would like to call a meeting to order Dr Albright may have a roll call please Yolanda Montoya Cordova period watching the live stream of upcoming meetings by clicking on the live stream

[00:01:00]
on the live meeting stream button on the main board page at www.aps.edu you can also email input comments and questions to board members at boarded at aps.edu or calling 505-880-3729 our first item for consideration and action is approving the agenda however I want to remind board members that there is no discussion once we get to the consent calendar if you'd like to remove items off the calendar you need to speak up now so I would like to move it for and with those changes of the agenda

[00:02:00]
the second Yolanda b c e and f correct yes correct so I guess do we need to vote on that or we do you have emotion in a second and with that I guess the next item for consideration in action

[00:03:00]
are next item for consideration and action is item for B consideration for approval of the qualification based bid in the amount of 9,600,000 + bidlot one in the amount of $233,000 plus applicable taxes admitted by Frank and construction for Monte Vista Elementary School classroom building addition and administration Renovations and Dr Gabriella Blakey or chief operations officer and Karen executive director Capital Construction

[00:04:00]
Dr Blakey did you want to say anything no I think we're open for questions we're open for questions period so I was just looking at the cost per square foot was $517 and I don't think since I've been on the board that I have that as far as I remember and I could be mistaken that I've ever seen that cost so high am I correct you're pretty correct we've had we've had to come close but I just when I saw these bids recently with this group it frankly took my breath away the cost of construction has gone up considerably and this is just an example of that and so

[00:05:00]
construction has should be starting correct well if you approve this item it will begin in probably after the first of the year okay so then my other question and I know this is just conjecture is when we're looking at the cost and I just saw a contingency of 529,000 if the cost keep going up like what do we do so if the cost to go up or even if they stay the same trying to sound positive here if they we probably won't be able to do all of the construction projects that we plan to do so then we of course nothing ever goes away we just hold on to it longer until we have the additional funds to do the construction so just kind of goes to take a little bit longer for that to happen I mean this is something

[00:06:00]
but Monte Vista truly truly need so I know we're all you know I'm sure we're all in support of it it just kind of took my took my breath away a question that I have and I know this isn't going to help now to help it all right now but I know with the davis-bacon requirements that you know obviously labor costs are inflated they are higher and I know you told me this before but if you could refresh my memory about how much that really adds to to the cost is that about 25 to 30 minutes by skills or craft so but the Davis baby bacon is what we call it here in New Mexico hasn't really gone up this last year so these These are other issues these

[00:07:00]
staffing issues and materials cost and the supply chain issues these are all the things that I think we're seeing right now I don't believe with the exception of the staffing issues that it's the labor cost so much that have increased in or causing this at this point in time okay so if we didn't have little Davis bacon here in in New Mexico pricing it would be the same we'd be paying the exact same cost for labor I'm thinking that they'd be pretty competitive I mean we just recently started looking at the federal wage rates for a project that's coming to you in the future Sandia base you know where we're getting that big Grant from the feds and with a couple of exceptions most of the trades were pretty competitive and remember that

[00:08:00]
davis-bacon and baby bacon are minimum standards they they don't they're not maximums their minimum so a construction company can start there and give them way more money they just can't pay less than the baby bacon and that all deals if I'm correct cuz I haven't read it in a long time is that you know baby or little Davis bacon it deals with government projects so this has nothing to do with you know private bills it's just has to do with Government Federal Government School anything to do with those kinds of bills so in the private sector it's much less expensive just because they don't have to abide by little bacon Davis and so I know that it's just turning to me that the public is having to pay more so and it'll be the same with the next one so that's just always concerning because we

[00:09:00]
dealing with a Publix money I think that's all and then also of course with the lead cost that you know we can build to lead standards we don't have to have to pay for that but well I just hope that we get this you know done soon so we can do everything else that's that we need to do on that priority list so thank you Michelle thank you any other comments or questions but I will go ahead and just say that Baby Davis that can afford the basic cost of living and it would come around and hit us in any number of ways and one question I do have do we have any mechanism you know every time we we

[00:10:00]
approve a contractor I'm always curious do we have any way of following up in terms of the quality of work once I mean I know there's serve that basic walkthrough of making sure that everything is finished but you know we haven't a number of schools where it seems like things start breaking and and not being the way they should sooner than when would want and do we have any mechanism for keeping track of what contractors really and truly made the specifications and put contractors maybe we should keep an eye on for future closely in terms of

[00:11:00]
just the issues that we have during construction and during the warranty period and then we are often brought in much later after the warranty period when something fails but I will tell you that one of the strong reasons for the contractors that we bring before you as the recommended Choice are often the ones that we can call even 20 years later I mean they may tell us that they have a two or three year warranty on certain things but I tell them that they have a lifetime warranty because as long as I'm there I'm going to call him back if it's an issue I have a company right now working on an issue a long issues long-standing issue we've had it burn a fossil just anytime there's a problem that we just can't really figure out or figure out how to fix I call the General Contractors back in and they usually bring their subs

[00:12:00]
and we kind of get to the bottom of it so we do and we do track that that's when I do these reviews that's past performance that's where I I kind of ding them on those things I really appreciate that I think it's really important and so that's that's good to know thank you I'm thinking we should maybe pick the last four projects and maybe you could take us through your process of the on a regular basis that you're implementing to ensure quality

[00:13:00]
therapy happy to do that board member Dominguez I just want to add that you know the Public Works projects that are are done with public funds are overseen also by our department so prevailing wages are set by the Department of Workforce Solutions and it's based on the prevailing wages that are set by the trades in the union trades that come together our wages are not very competitive so we tend to lose a lot of workers to other states because their wages are not very high so I just want to add that and secondly I just want to add that the projects that are done by APS I know I think I said this with the previous board members but it was one of the first things that I looked at was to see if there was any lapses or you know individuals

[00:14:00]
obligations and there was none so I would say that it's a testament to our department Karen doing a really good job of staying on top of our contractors that are working at the there's I think they select quality contractors that come in and really I think spend the money in in the spirit of what its intended around the prevailing wages and all so in terms of Public Works no no issues with that so I was really impressed with that because you should have seen the other school districts there's definitely some significant concerns there so but it was nice to see that our projects were were not some of those projects that were coming up on our problem list period

[00:15:00]
in the amount of 33

[00:16:00]
587 130,000 right is that right I got it wrong 33,000,587,000 is that right yes 130 yeah that's right I'm still looking at the 33 million plus applicable taxes submitted by Thompson Construction Incorporated for Arroyo Del Oso Elementary School construction phase one and two and yes I remember this conversation with doctor for a complete rebuild of and we are open for any questions you have regarding the information

[00:17:00]
just because I know some concerns have been have been brought up after a bill has been done and there's problems so Dr Blakey Duran after there's a certificate of occupancy delivered then if there's a problem that comes up after that who's responsible for that is it the contractors who who's responsible or is that fall on APS it depends on the warranty but miss already can answer that question thank you yes so the contractor would be responsible for it we have an 11-month warranty for most things some items have longer warranties manufacturer warranties we usually we always have a 2-year warranty

[00:18:00]
on roofs but as I stated before if it's something that seems to be quality of workmanship or anything like that even if it's several years later or in my case I tell him lifetime I call the general contractor back and because we're a repeat client and they want our business we get a very very positive response from them they don't want things that you know they don't want to buy mark on their on their report card for the next proposal so they're pretty good about coming back period commercial but the materials are warrantied most cases for 20 years

[00:19:00]
roofs have 20-year warranties for the roof itself but on the workmanship and all of that it's a 2-year warranty okay so the material so good okay that's good and then I I know I don't and I'm going to say the same thing about bacon Davis since we have bacon Davis a little bacon Davis here in New Mexico and we look at states that don't and how their states are thriving economically and you look at Utah and Arizona on South Dakota North Dakota and Florida on their thriving and it doesn't seem to have helped lift our students out of poverty thank you so I have a this is from you guys went to have an informational session with the community and I was just wondering what the

[00:20:00]
Zach was at that information cuz I know you had it but I didn't hear how it went and I just would like to know what the feedback was it was really positive but I'll let Casino address that cuz I was out of town is Jackson Mendes of the board yes we met with I think it was area 4 coal of neighborhood associations that's all the neighborhood associations in the Northeast Heights and we had a very positive interactions in telling them basically about the design telling them about the timeline telling them about the park will be out of commission for the duration of the Bill of the school and we also have City of Albuquerque at the meeting with us and their

[00:21:00]
about the community that they will coordinate with the community for the use of the park and when we rebuild the park it will still remain a joint use Park and APS will go ahead and rebuild it they kept the drawings of the building as an informational item and their displayed in the lobby of the Santa Domingo Community Center lobby and also they want us to come back in April and give them an update on a couple of things number security program on the schools they're very interested in that and they are so interested in

[00:22:00]
the energy saving criteria that we are employing on our construction and so will be setting that up and will be letting you know how many just as an estimate how many parents do you think were like people who attend a lot so was it just purely for Arroyo Del Oso or was it the district for neighborhood Coalition and just curious how many people who would be at a royal deloso were there so it was the District 4 neighborhood called Coalition and all its able to Association president as you know about 4 months ago we had a premium PTA and so we met with the parents of the PTA and we had a meeting and we did the same presentation to them

[00:23:00]
and we also had I think three parents and two students on the design committee from from the from the school on the design Committee of the design for the school I received the email that didn't have a follow-up so I'm glad to know that it was would you say it was well received very well received there were very complimentary on them actually reaching out to them and letting them know what's going to go on in the neighborhood and they want to continue that kind of connection with what we do with the school with his follow-up meeting in March well and I appreciate you reaching out to them and letting him know what's going on so thank you that was all I had no problem anymore

[00:24:00]
so this particular project has been how long in the drawer I mean we initiated the conversations around us I know in 2018 we approve it it's been I mean this community has been waiting for a long time correct 2018 on our list of items in 2016 so yes we can check on where the financing is coming from a combination of funds that came through and 2010 and 2016 so I mean so I think I think it's just and the only reason I bring that up is just for a new members is to understand how long it takes sometimes with these bigger projects like this you know 33 million is a lot of money I know with the Rio Grande Jim we we waited I think through two

[00:25:00]
to finally get that done and it does frustrate the community so I just kind of gives you a perspective of how many years it takes for us to actually launch you know from inception to actually launching so I'm excited that it's finally going to happen cuz I know this is a school that was been slated for replacement for quite a number of years so thank you board member Peterson so just for general information number of states have higher average constriction

[00:26:00]
I hope you realize that you have talked yourself into a position in which you may never retire we expect you to be here for a very very very very very very long time and thank you for all that work and I'll move for approval all second Yolanda and doctoral Cordova yes yes yes yes yes sir to have construction moving on to the next item item D consideration for approval of the architectural selection advisory committee

[00:27:00]
recommendation for Award of architectural services for Van Buren middle school classroom block to design plus LLC Dr Boudin blakey's Locker to get demolished going away however I just wanted to check with Dr Albright I think this one is coming down so we are consideration for approval for disposition of 10 + Acres of Northwest between Unser Boulevard and Golf Course road is this

[00:28:00]
okay so I believe this board member Moeller article and who asked for this to be pulled so I don't know if this would go to miss Vallarta I'm not sure when was this land purchased do I know you may not have been here when it was purchased but can you tell me when that land was purchased I can get you that information from my digital file that's not a question that I was prepared to answer so give me just a moment and by the time in a few minutes I'll have the deed pulled for you okay and then at the time I know you weren't here either but at the time for 10:00 what was the plan

[00:29:00]
for that Lounge when it was purchased so Peggy acre Parcels on the West Side were donated to us over the years so we have 10 acre Parcels throughout the west side that at one point were donated and we're not necessarily purchased by the district we have them throughout this area well it seems like it's in the middle of development now it was in the middle of nowhere 25 years ago when we did obtain it and I'm still pulling that deed if you guys have anything to add to that so I mean I'm just thinking 25 years ago I mean I'm just thinking 10 acres now in 2022 what could we build on 10 I mean can you get me an example of what

[00:30:00]
we could build on 10 we could all go ahead and respond to that we could build an elementary school it would be small a smaller one but we could build an elementary school on 10 acres we have elementary schools on much smaller sites if you think about Coronado and Lew Wallace I mean they're on city blocks basically so it could be done yeah it could be done but they are problematic we do like to have a little bit bigger site for our elementary schools but it could be done definitely okay but we're not thinking that that is a possibility and that's why we want to dispose of it because we're not thinking that this one is a little problematic because they've already been on that property the City of Albuquerque with their Road already in it so we don't have the full 10 acres even now and now and now they want to widen the street so

[00:31:00]
need more property and they're already there so it's kind of a government government exchange and Miss Vallarta if you could just get us if it was you know a donation we're always thankful for that I know building a small Elementary School on the west side is really help with the growth on the west side so that's probably not even really too much of an option so I mean I I was just wondering about it so if it was a donation thank you if it wasn't though I would be concerned about why and so that could be a follow-up if it wasn't a donation and we did choose to buy it why did we chose to buy it you know who made that decision and what was the plan I mean I've lived on the west side my whole life so even 25 years ago I lived in that area yes ma'am Madam we we received it by warranty deed

[00:32:00]
1872 by Horizon Corporation so Horizon Corporation owned a lot of this land back in the in the late 60s early 70s and it was probably donated to APS so they could say that a school was coming there but that was before Paseo Del Norte or any of the major infrastructure was put in in this area right then High School in 1972 so I know what it look like out there and I know what would happen out there there was nothing there was nothing out there in 1972 okay that's I mean that's just what I thought so thank you you have thank you mister we we always do long-term assessment

[00:33:00]
from where we think population will go so when we go ahead and acquire land and bank we call it land banking it's on our best projection on where population will go because if you wait till you see rooftops and you start thinking about buying land you're not going to be buying Acres as you know you'll be buying lots and we won't be able to buy the land it'll be prohibitively expensive but what happens when many times is that quite a few of our Apostles 10 years 15 years after we buy the land and blanket we do Bill school facilities but there's some old pieces that end up not being in the right places and what we try and do is we

[00:34:00]
either exchange or sell that land and the money goes back into the real estate fund to go ahead and buy land for schools and educational facilities for the future that's why we've been able to do this and this will started by superintendent building and kept up by the boards of Education that way we don't usually go to the taxpayer or anybody in terms of going to buy land and less as what happened a few years ago we depleted the last bank so much that we had to go to the taxpayer and ask them for some money to buy land as you know 10 years ago we build 12 new schools most of them on the west side and it was and so if

[00:35:00]
we are going into a period right now that we need to start building up our land Banks again because 10 years from now as the economy picks up and the city changes with the Board of Education and the school district at that time will need this land thank you thank you for that information now

[00:36:00]
baby development has overtaken it and so we're and that's why real estate office at this time is coming to you with these two suggestions in terms of due to analysis it's a reset time and we need to rearrange Our Land Bank okay so we're doing this basically so that we have some other options by freeing up this land exactly the other thing is I'm curious but it seems like it's all bleeding together with questions about land Parcels do we talk at all with the city about potential open space like thinking about Facebook Community collaborative school I know when when that was developed we talked about some of the potential for some really nice

[00:37:00]
Creative Connections with the national park that's out there and open space do we have the district been in conversation with the city about any of these parcels and how to utilize them so that they really are useful to the community even if they're not in our possession good afternoon good afternoon Miss Board member we are in I talked to the city on a regular basis as you know we negotiated the 48 joint news parks with the city I meet with City open space if you recall on the board approved and easement for the Petroglyph National Park approximately 24 months ago and that is just west of Trussville comma so it's an access road that the National Park is going to Annex into the boundary and add upgraded amenities that are going to allow our students in the community

[00:38:00]
around this area to access the national park with the roadway and they're going to probably end up putting a gazebo and bathrooms and so forth so that is in the works and we have also spoke to open space open space would love this parcel of land as a buffer but the appraised value because when we built sorry we're going to Trussville comma so we're kind of stepping ahead from the Paseo Del Norte question yes they would love this as a buffer but they have not approached us about particularly buying it but they would be interested in it if it was made available it seems like I mean it does seem like with with that in mind both of these Parcels of land have some real potential use that we can't make use of but maybe Insurance in Partnership they can be really useful for the community

[00:39:00]
thank you so I just had a quick question this this parcel banking is interesting and thank you for explaining it who keeps track of which Parcels we have donated to the bank who's who's the bank who's in charge of making sure that we get credit so that when we need to go to the City of Albuquerque in a couple of years we can say well we've donated this now you can give back to us so Miss Jackson if I met the bank is not like a physical Bank where we exchange property with the City of Albuquerque so most of our properties with in collaboration we maintain ownership of those so the 48 joint use parks are on APS property in collaboration with the city in the past when we exchanged a property which it's been about 25 years since we've exchanged a property with

[00:40:00]
City of Albuquerque it was for a park in the Northeast Heights and it's a park today and inconsideration we were given two other Parcels adjacent to one of our to two of our elementary schools in exchange for that park that is still a park today and so it was traded equally acrost we don't trade and leave money in the bank it has to be traded for equal property of value yeah so I guess that's that's to my question I realize there's not an actual bank I am I'm wondering like with this 10 plus parcel that were just giving back what who like is it is it kept track somewhere is it just good graces and how was it how was it later allocated that we have given back these two lands like Mr was just talking about the

[00:41:00]
we're putting it into a bank and it's for later when we need to we're building up the bank and when we need to go to the city later or other governmental agencies later like who's keeping track of what we're giving back I guess so Miss Jackson we would actually still sell this for phone market value or exchange currently to the City of Albuquerque we would not just give this to the City of Albuquerque we made it so we are exchanging this 10 acre parcel of land for something else or selling it for sale or for sale okay so we are we are putting it up for sale or we're exchanging it but we haven't done that yet correct

[00:42:00]
okay and the same thing is about to happen with baseball cards correct except for this one is needed for Rodeway for Paseo Del Norte so it's already encumbrance with the roadway and so from government to government it's a little streamlined well I guess that was a question if they already in our land shouldn't they compensate us for encumbering Upon Our Land yes okay yes I'm seeing lots of head shakes okay so somebody is going to go to the City of Albuquerque and say you have already encumbered Upon Our Land we expect recompense sorry I've been with the district for five years so when they came to us for the widening of paseo I pulled our documentation to discover that it was never conveyed over to the city so we're actually correcting something that happened in the past

[00:43:00]
and they will have to pay us for the full price of the 10 acres or exchange it for something that the district deems is beneficial so we won't just exchanged it for like a drainage Pond over here it has to be something that benefits the district thank you that clears it up very nicely I appreciate it I want to point out that this was a topic at the mid Regional of governments in a way there was a contractor there and small small contractor and he was representing I believe a voice complaints from other developers that said there's no you guys need to quit putting in infrastructure and and the city or

[00:44:00]
yes they recognized that they could not do that until they took care of other expenses which I think I had to do with what we're talking about here I think so it's interesting how it all comes together so are we ready for a vote on this item this is Courtney yes yes Crystal consideration for approval by the Board of Education to declare

[00:45:00]
West Acres of vacant land next to Tres volcanes Community collaborative K-8 as Surplus and I think I'm Miss Allred do you want to save some words about this first or do we want to go through the question I think based on the fact that we've sort of discussed it and sort of bled into this one will just stand for questions right now okay so I know this was purchased back in 2011 and I think I read do you know what the purchase price was back then cuz that would have been for all the 110 + 8 Acres actually it was $228 Acres at the time but we've used some of it for Facebook on us and we both use some of it for the westside's stadium the stadium sits on

[00:46:00]
35,000 per acre at the time that we purchased it it was raw land I know where it is so I mean the only true question that I have is when I was just looking at I mean living out there and knowing about all that volcanic rock and how difficult it is to just prepare a site with you know it's very very difficult to do so I know that that we spoke a little bit you all spoke a little bit to how much it you know if it costs so when you when somebody was deciding about purchasing this this piece of you know property can you tell me how that like

[00:47:00]
poisonous made I mean does an engineer does you know Miss Valerie go out there do you go out to look at the topography to go out and look at I mean I'm I'm just just because I live and I would think it be really difficult to build their just because I live where I see all the volcanic rocks so I know how hard that is just to try to even move it so I mean was that taken into consideration all back when you all were purchasing so I do now go out to see the sights that were considering but there were many times that land was purchased you know before I got here and even when I first started here that I was involved in so you know it's Lessons Learned we get sites that are very difficult to build on this happens to be one of them okay I mean I could just see the moving excavation I mean I just think it would

[00:48:00]
just cost a whole you know ton of money so and then I know when you send the stadium was built there as well as well so I know you said that was 5 million was the cost to try to get the land already was that inclusive of the state and you send a stadium was there a car was there a big cost there was that separate cost then well there there was a big there wasn't as big a costume there because you know that's a bowl you know that Stadium but when you're trying like a school needs to be flat because we have accessibility issues right we can't really do clever things like have small houses going up a hill and make that charming and stuff we can't do that we need flat and so no the 5 million was for Connors to make that site buildable was 5 million there's basically is I can't remember now 70 or 80 foot drop on that site so we have to deal with

[00:49:00]
and it's expensive I know I have a friend that's trying to do that now and it's like a year and a half into it and it is just doubling the price of what it was going to cost to just build the home so it is just really going to be really expensive but I'm I'm I'm I'm glad that you all a lesson learned about making sure to go out and look out there so thank you miss all right for making sure that you do that and in future purchases we know that we're probably not going to buy anything that has too much volcanic rock it's beautiful just left out there any house so do we think I know this is just thinking that and I mean I could see that being used for a neighborhood I'm I'm hopeful I'm hopeful that will be able to sell that quickly but this is going to have to go through a different process because this is

[00:50:00]
I'm going to have to go not just here but it's also going to have to go to the State Board of finance and so they're going to also have to approve that as well so who's going to be speaking at the State Board of Finance to get that approval there so really there's five approvals this is just the very first step the State Board of Finance is the last step and there's a couple in between that Amanda I think has memorized but this is a very long complicated process and actually I'll let Amanda talk about it it probably be the very people you see here will be speaking at the State Board of Finance so it'll probably talk to you know Amanda and myself a little bit about the process Amanda thank you board member so the board of education is the first step of approval and because we're a state entity we're also going to require public education department

[00:51:00]
Tax and Revenue approval and then the last step is the State Board of Finance so we have been working in the in the last 5 years I've been working closely pulling up all the directives and the requirements we've never went through the process well I shouldn't say never it's been about 25 years since APS went through the process of going out to a competitive bid to dispose of real property so we will be working very closely with our legal counsel and our real estate professionals to prepare all the documentation because as we go through this process of getting this deemed Surplus there's going to be a lot of boxes and approvals to check so we're prepared for that so this is just the very first step in the process to Deema parcel Surplus and work through the disposition process okay so how long do you anticipate it may take before we finally get to the board of Finance

[00:52:00]
will a typical Landslide takes approximately 6 to 9 months and that would be a typical you know due diligence time frame on a land parcel this this is a piece of this is a piece of land that still part of Trussville Connors collaborative so the school district will have to go through the reply in order to get it as a separate parcel and pull titles and so I would say 6 to 9 months is hopeful I think that it's going to end up taking us probably longer than that but we hope that we're very far along in the process we would like to initiate the process first quarter of 2023 okay so that's 78 Acres so hopefully we're looking for 70 at least 78 Acres out on the west side cuz I know we're going to need that so I appreciate it and thank you Michelle and I appreciate you going out there and putting your work boots on and getting out there and

[00:53:00]
dim climbing up that rock thank you I'll move for approval a second Yolanda okay Dr Albright we're ready for a local Cordova yes yes Barbara Peterson yes yes yes I should have marked down so I just I just want to say I'm excited about moving forward

[00:54:00]
turn it's long overdue and really really really really really hope that the Architects really work with the school because especially the school garden and the role that that plays both educationally academically within the school and the connections with the community outside of the school are really critical and so I just I really my only concern is that there be a real collaborative effort between architect and and school community in that process and that I am happy to say second yes yes Crystal

[00:55:00]
I think that the next Capital outlay Property and Technology committee meeting will be Monday January 9th 2023 at 5:00 p.m. in the John Milton Community boardroom of the Alison Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or virtually at www.aps.edu and with that we are adjourned
