school board members my name is Dr head out to chanello I'm going to Alternative Health doctor in the minister it's no secret that New Mexico is public education system has been rated as one of if not the worst in the nation the lack of funding is not an issue accountability for positive outcome is the problem according to city desk ABQ APS student enrollment is expected to drop again the numbers cost District 2.5 million dollars did you know we didn't have this problem over for years ago so what what happened do you remember in my last few books by Dr Grossman Lost in Translation and info on Dr Victorville

[00:06:00]
what do you think the solution is for the common sense that the the gender affirming care policy is the problem so do you remember and not the the 2.5 million monetary issues do you remember section 2254 of the public school code a local School Board sell they have the following parts of Duties subject to the rules of the department developed educational policy for the school districts Solutions shouldn't you develop educational policy starting with Reading Writing arithmetic and not sexual policies of perversion mutilation castration which are actually unhealthy and harmful to our students number tuition you listen to your constituents and students parents who know what's best for their children to raise and care for you nearly your parents I know my parents did relatives in Cincinnati public schools so please stop talking trash

[00:07:00]

[00:08:00]
question of the administration specifically she asked is the use of the district adopted curriculum optional for teachers and if so what is the strategy to encourage you to use if mandatory does a strategy exist to address the use of non-district adopted curriculum thank you for that question unfortunately the administration's response wasn't completely clear to me what I think I understood that was at the use of District approved high-quality instructional materials is highly encouraged and it is the desire of the administration but it's not mandatory indeed alternate instruction that does not meet District standards is still allowed to be used as a parent I find this troubling and I would like to respectfully encourage the board and ultimately the administration to strongly consider mandating the implementation of District approved high-quality instructional materials in every classroom in the district parents absolutely need the peace of mind that their children are receiving the best education possible and high-quality instructional materials are foundational for ensuring this there are ways to do this while still allowing teachers to innovate in its

[00:09:00]
it must be done in a thoughtful way that provides our excellent teachers the resources and support they need listen the board and administration now and over the last few years have accomplished huge Feats and implementing transformational structural changes at APS your community is paying attention and I'll tell you for the first time in a long time we have some hope we parents can feel it you are turning the corner so now we are begging you to not take the foot off the gas let's have the courage not as a board or an Administration but as a community the mandatory implementation of District approved high-quality instructional materials in every classroom is The Logical Next Step you have our support on this please let's get this done thank you thank you our next speaker is Michael Anderson you have two minutes once you begin speaking I live for Jim I breathe for Jim I watch a clock and Jim

[00:10:00]
hooray it's in the gym I feel so good I lived there if I only could if I could have Jim the whole day through why then I'd always Dash to school good afternoon president Gonzalez and bored board members my name is Michael Anderson I'm the physical education teacher at Inez Elementary School that was a poem written by a student of mine over 10 years ago what Adrienne didn't write was how much he actually needed physical education he was a student who had been through extensive trauma had high levels of anxiety and acted out everywhere but in my class he not only needed the variety of movement skills topically emotional lessons that are taught in constantly practiced in peace more than 10 years later or students are less physically mentally and emotionally healthy they are experiencing higher incidence of depression and anxiety and healthy positive social interaction

[00:11:00]
are difficult for them about a month ago I wrote a letter expressing concern over the district's cutting a physical education programs throughout the district we know through research that increasing not decreasing PE not only improves health and wellness metrics but also academic performance I'm here to ask in person for an opportunity to speak to the board and Leadership about ways to improve the quality and quantity of physical education throughout the district if a student struggles in math they may not grow up to be an accountant if they have a difficult time finding their voice in their writing they may not grow up to be an author I fear for the health and wellness of students who are physically illiterate if they aren't taught how to take care of the one body they have nothing else really matters kids deserve full-time physical education thank you sir and board members that includes public forum

[00:12:00]
thank you to our public forum speakers I was very engrossed in the comments I didn't have my script up we are going to move now to our next agenda item which is agenda item number 5 it just focused on student outcomes focused governance for this agenda item we have a couple of big items which are really the bulk of our agenda for today 5.1 and 5.2 so 5.1 is on our time use board time use evaluation as a reminder for the public our board is monitoring and evaluating assessing how we are using our time as a board and similarly to what extent we're using that time to actually talk about and monitor student outcomes so our board secretary has been responsible for that and will provide the overview on that the second student outcomes Focus governance priority on 5.2 is our self-evaluation so we're all so evaluating ourselves against a rubric for Effective governance

[00:13:00]
part of the time use monitoring falls into that as well which is why we're doing it first but we're eager to improve and eager to serve the community effectively and eager to maintain the focus on student outcomes so with that I'll turn it over to agenda to a board secretary for board agenda item 5.1 board time use evaluation thank you I am really excited to present this I know a lot of you that watch the meetings and attend the zoom or attend the board meetings hear us really talking to each other throughout the progress monitoring telling each other that we don't have effective questions or making sure the Strategic questions and that is all done with the purpose so when we move to the student outcomes Focus governance model we wanted to make sure that everything that we do here on board meetings and as a board is really focus on student outcomes so we want to make sure that the questions that we asked for the progress monitoring presentations are really

[00:14:00]
live in making sure that what we do as a board is falling our rules right making sure that everything is progressing in a way that it should but also being super strategic and critical with the questions that we ask so that things are moving in a positive way so as we've learned how to do these time keeping and using the time use evaluation forms I'll share my screen in a bit I just want to kind of go over we've been learning a lot and I will say a lot of us feel like using this time use evaluation has helped us take a step back and Applause when we're actually asking questions learning the material and making sure that we are understanding not only how to be a more effective board but how to be active participants in a way that's helpful to the presenters so we're all working together and making sure that what we do here is in the benefit of our students so I will share first just the monthly tracking and I'm going to try and do this let's see

[00:15:00]
and if you want more information on the time use evaluation board member Jackson did an amazing job describing that in the January 17th meetings so if you haven't gone back to look at board meetings that would be a great opportunity to do so okay I think it's coming up so I want to start first with November and December this is when we started our evaluation and you don't know how okay so in the blue column that those are the minutes that we focus on student outcomes right this is our progress monitoring I can make it a little bit bigger so for November we had zero right so for a regular board meeting on the first of November we had a board meeting that was 150 minutes and there was no

[00:16:00]
time where we talked about progress monitoring student outcomes anything like that same with December none of those minutes were accounted towards our progress monitoring or student outcomes as we move into January our regular board meeting you'll see Zero because it was just the swearing in so we won't count that meeting but the second meeting the second regular board meeting we had 78 minutes that we focused on student outcomes so this is through the progress monitoring presentation the questions conversations during that time which is really really great and then let me just move this so we take all the averages out and for that month of January we had 22% of our time spent on speaking about student outcomes which is obviously a huge jump from 0% so it might sound little but it's really great for us and then we also have the policy meetings we're going to work on those okay we'll work on those and

[00:17:00]
measuring those we also had a couple of special board meetings that don't count because they were in executive session because of the superintendent search we also had some engagement opportunities that didn't count because the board wasn't the one presenting to the community so those didn't count in January but moving to the month of February we did have other engagements that should be fixed I'm so sorry about that we did have engagements at counted towards our points so I will fix that but on the regular board meeting in February we had 68 points and then on our second board meeting we had 50 points so we're moving along our present keeps increasing this is the one that I'm excited about is our regular board meeting for the last it was the last one in March we had 88 minutes out of 12

[00:18:00]
so a total of 73% of our board meeting was focused on student outcomes which is kind of tricky is that it all averages out in the month so technically it was 33% for the March month but in this specific board meeting I also wanted to give a round of applause to our board members because our coach Ashley pause said that it was one of our best board meetings yet and all of our questions were really great the discussion was on point and you can really tell that we're progressing through all of this so even for us as board members we go back and we watch our board meeting you can tell the growth from the first board meeting and asking questions to how now we asked her teacher questions and we monitor each other so I think that's the best part is throughout this process we're holding ourselves to accountable and each other to make sure that we're sticking to what our goal is but yes so super amazing results right now around yeah

[00:19:00]
so our last again our last board meeting was 73% I wanted to also share I don't know what I'm doing sorry it's hard to like do the zoo so this is how we track it real quick I want to show you this is the policy meeting so there's nothing there but for gold monitoring here this is the 88 Minutes used on the last board meeting I don't know other section there was other stuff that we did right but the chunk of it was bent on just monitor progress monitoring on numbers on March 6th we had the consent agenda and budget presentation and then we went to some other things so that's kind of how we measure it right is looking at how much time we spend on doing other presentations in the board meetings instead of just focusing

[00:20:00]
so one of the things that I will suggest to the board is possibly moving some of those bigger presentations like the budget presentations or other presentations that we have to maybe the finance committee meetings or other meetings that doesn't affect our time keeping our time use evaluation because even though we might have great conversations for 60 minutes if we have a presentation that's longer than that or more extensive than that then we end up taking time away from our time you say evaluation so it's just something to think about but yeah I'm going to stop sharing there and just say we're doing a great job and please continue to do what you're doing one of the things that we also want to remind folks is that if you see us on our phones or on our laptops during the meetings it's because we do have a live coaching from our coach Ashley pause so we're constantly making sure that we're training ourselves and being efficient in

[00:21:00]
play in those things so that's a good thing if you see us kind of checking on each other or please don't make please don't let it seem like we're being a little frisky to each other when we're saying that's not a real question and that's not a right question because that's just helping each other out and making sure that we're on the right page so one of the next things that I also wanted to say is that I did the time keeping from January to March and we will be going through the district so I'm district one so next will be District Two that will be evaluating us on time use so we'll be making sure that each and every one of us not only does that but also is monitoring the conversation so we'll take turns kind of checking in on each other because we want to make sure that we all understand what that process looks like and we all have a chance to to kind of be the bad guy right we don't want to fall in one person so yeah we're we're moving forward it's going good and I feel like it's just helped us as a board grow and hopefully you all can see that as well but yeah

[00:22:00]
I can stand for any questions or comments thank you Secretary of still together for that report and it's even better that it's a positive report because we're all so the kind of personalities that like to get good grades so we're excited about that I'd like to just open the floor to any questions from board members for secretary historic about the time use evaluation I have a question will we get a copy of the documents that you had on the screen yes so I will share this with everyone and then I would also love to do a one-on-one with each of you just to kind of go over how to use this evaluation form perfect I will add to that I also have a cute up to send to everybody a coaching Memo from our associate coach Ashley pause which includes all of her evaluation of that meeting in particular that March 20th meeting so she reviewed each of the questions

[00:23:00]
he said the meeting was excellent she said all of our questions were strategic and that we did everything that we were supposed to do and it was a model monitoring session so that coaching memo will be sent to you it'll come from Miss King it'll be sent to the full board and I didn't want to take the thunder away from secretary historica in terms of sharing how much time we did spend on students in the particular meeting but it's just a really positive report of course there's areas for improvement but positive report that everyone should be really proud of are there other questions on time use evaluation don't have a question just a quick comment thank you that was a really good summary and I find this to be someone complex because I'm just started and I think you did a really good job explaining it so I don't want to offer my appreciation on that awesome so with that that allows us to have some content to move into our self-evaluation which is agenda item five

[00:24:00]
approval of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance self why can't I talk today self evaluation for year to quarter to so as we've discussed already student outcomes focused governance is a framework that's designed to drive the board's ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective promise to improve student outcomes this is the process of calibration and recalibration that allows us to align and realign our governing governing behaviors with those most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes board members have been asked to individually complete evaluation form for our board actions from last quarter we ask numbers to complete the evaluation to come into the meeting with their scores and we're going to discuss the scores in the meeting going forward we may decide to have people submit their ratings in advance so that we have that reading and we could just sort of jump into it

[00:25:00]
but we just need to figure out the timing on the deadlines for that type of stuff but that's sort of the process before we proceed going into the actual rubric and the ratings do any board members have questions about the process all right thank you then I will go ahead and we'll go through and review the results for each of the six competencies of the sosg self-evaluation so I just want to State and run through with the six competencies are we have vision and vision and goals sorry values and guardrails three is monitoring into accountability for communication and collaboration 5 unity and trust and 6:00 minutes against all six of those different categories and competencies we're going to start with vision and goals which is the most important thing because that's what that's why our board exists we are on our last rating had received 10 points which is

[00:26:00]
Rudy darn good on our evaluation and so I would just like to open it up to folks and see if you think we have changed in our reading where folks rated us for vision and goals I'm saying shaking head so we stayed at 10:00 does anyone want to share why you didn't answer to the green comma and which would have earned us 25 points yeah it's because we do not yet have annual targets is why I couldn't bump us over to the 25th yet so yes and we did try to schedule that to happen before this meeting but just with the transition and superintendent and travel we weren't able to get there but we are expecting those annual targets to actually be presented in and approved at our next meeting April 17th so we'll just be a couple weeks short but major progress

[00:27:00]
mission and goals as a 10 next is values and guard rails where we had previously rated as a buy does anyone think we've moved up into the green column meeting tonight I don't believe so because I think we were waiting on a new superintendent to help with the theories of change are the reason I'm sorry the theories of action and then all the interim ending points for the guardrails all right so we're going to agree okay so we're staying at 5 for values and guardrails next up is monitoring accountability we had previously rated ourselves as a zero which is the red column and so does anyone think that we've moved out of

[00:28:00]
that into approaching student outcomes Focus as a 10 and earn 10 points on Earth to the 10 because we have been using more than 10% of our authorized time wandering schools great so that first point we have invested more than 10% on monitoring anyone else have comments or feedback on monitoring and accountability and I was also waiting to hear on our time use evaluation to see if we had gotten to 10% so that's great that we have but where I am pausing is that the very end where it says the superintendent is evaluated only on performance regarding the board schools and we can't say that yet so not quite there yet

[00:29:00]
anyone else with comments on monitoring and accountability so that raises a question when will we evaluate the superintendent on the goals and the guard with the guard rails that won't be for another year is that correct after July 1st will be there for at least another year and some months I also in the red column the board has not consistently demonstrated the ability to distinguish between customer service issues and owner service issues I think actually continues to be a challenge for us so for the sake of the public customer service is exactly what it sounds like responding to constituent and Community needs we as board members get a lot of emails inquiries request questions from families Educators School leaders folks out in the public who want us to solve a problem for them and that's not the job of the

[00:30:00]
customer service because we're the board and we're governing board we provide owner service but some of us are still trying to or actually providing that customer service so that's another one where I think we haven't quite moved out of the red column yet but we're working on it and we do have a training coming up on April 29th and 30th on Sophie's will specifically dig into this point in particular to get a little bit more guidance around how we should be handling those customer service inquiries that we're receiving so we are a zero for monitoring accountability next up is communication and collaboration we had previously scored as a one which is the orange juice comma anyone have anything to say around whether we move on this one or more points or notch

[00:31:00]
I think we're still at the same level of what we rated out before because when we talked about that the board limits the adoption of policies regarding school that particular section that's where I feel like we fall green yes that's what I wrote down anyone else I did have some questions around the number of authorized public meetings evaluation so when I counted the number of January board authorized public meetings at 7:00 so do we not count we only count regular board meetings special board meetings policy meetings and then engagement events we don't do Financial or anything like that but if it was a special board meeting which we then had to call and then go into an executive is that we have to still report it

[00:32:00]
but it's 0 minutes but for this there were more than six board authorized public meetings in a single month it won't count period evaluation you can you have to put that there was closed sessions but under the percentage it's any so it just doesn't count so they were not more than six authorized public meetings in January your your account have three I think my account only had three we can definitely check with Ashley and make sure I would like us to earn those points which is only one but that's reassuring because I had counted seven meetings so for only counting the three then we are earning that one point for communication and collaboration does anyone disagree with that we're all in agreement right next up is you so we're staying at 1 we're staying at 1 okay yes I agree next up is unity and Trust we had previously scored

[00:33:00]
3 which is meeting student outcomes Focus to earn a 5:00 we need to move into that blue column around mastering student outcomes Focus does anyone have anything to say on unity and trust and there's work to be done on that in that category can I asked for clarification on that so when we talked about the current status of beach are we referring to what it looks like on the progress monitoring reports being able to speak at that my memory is that

[00:34:00]
I agree and I'm seeing lots of folks nodding in agreement with that anything else on the blue that folks want to discuss and also says that we are most recent score was 80% or higher so we definitely don't move up or not so I have a quick question so even in numbers in three right in the green so it says we've included link so we have included language in our ethics and conflicts of interest statement that says board members do not give operational advice but based on some of our out of glances that have come out it kind of leads me to assume or believe that there is still some operational advice but does that mean given but does that

[00:35:00]
during the most recent self-evaluation than none of the board members have given operational advice or instructions to staff members or not there we have it in policy words at 3 all right folks ready to move to continuous Improvement all right on this one we had rated a 0 not student

[00:36:00]
how do folks feel we stand now we have not yet participated in the governance so zero so what I have is vision and goals 10 values and guardrails five monitoring and accountability zero communication and collaboration one unity and Trust 3 continuous Improvement zero

[00:37:00]
so we did not meet that goal it was that we'd get up we would have got a lot of points particular so to go back and to set a goal for the next quarter for looking at vision and goals if we have the annual targets that will earn us $25 points so that'll help significantly putting us in that green do we feel we could get all the way to 35 so bye June so when we do this again in July will we have been using a process that includes you can read for yourself the blue column

[00:38:00]
does anyone think we can make it to 35 points for mastering students parents you know that that's a tall order for and I'm thinking of our Martinez in African American population in particular it's where we're out there these goals and guardrails are still nebulous there's no there's not an ownership just yet that takes

[00:39:00]
does anyone feel differently all right so we'll set our goal for vision and goals at 25 for the next quarter for values and guardrails were sitting at 5:00 and the yellow approaching column we if we get the interim Focus which would be 10 if we get the theories of action from the superintendent we don't be a 10 and does anyone want to make the case that we could try to get into mastering for 15 points so we're going to start the goal at 10:00 sorry and I think the only reason that I'm hesitant on it is

[00:40:00]
cuz you know we the we have an Acting Superintendent right now I think she's still needs to get into the like fully take over that responsibility as superintendent and so because there is this second paragraph This is the superintendent is influenceable and that I just think she might need like two more months I think that's fair movie Parts okay monitoring an accountability we have a zero we talked about we need to improve our distinguished in between customer and owner services

[00:41:00]
are we still going to have the superintendent evaluation so we'll probably still be sitting at zero next quarter I have a question on that though yes however if our evaluation reflects our superintendent is going to be evaluated on these items wouldn't we get we wouldn't get the points or we would I think that case could be made for Q3 okay when we have a new superintendent having started but we're still this next quarter would be able to make in June or we're still in this room period and we would like to earn at least five by focusing on primarily that third one about the adoption of board policies regarding regarding school systems oper

[00:42:00]
and no changes to the agenda so folks feel like we could get to 5:00 no does this require let me read this again not yet existing policies that do not meet one of these criteria have been removed this is in reference to the policy diet is it not yes so checking in with that side of the admin side of the work I don't know so we don't know yet which is a good point but maybe we do have more policies that we need to talk to moving parts do we want to set the goal for 5 or we want to stick with one I think we need to set the Google for 5:00 and I think we can we can hit five

[00:43:00]
we are going through the policy diet process but we also you know just need to make sure that we're focusing on any policy we do is on student outcomes and not additional requests okay unity and Trust we have a three and we'd like to get into the five primarily or issue is giving operational advice or instructions to staff members so do we think we will have stopped that and agreed amongst all of us including the superintendent's agreement that we're not doing that this would be by the end of June for when we're doing the July evaluation yes I can say yes for myself continuous Improvement we will buy the next session have done a governance training so we'll get out of that

[00:44:00]
we also need to begin to track the annual cost of Staff time to get one point there and I think that's just going to depend on additional coaching but maybe let's go for one point 25 values and guardrails 10 monitoring accountability zero communication and collaboration 5 unity and Trust 5 continuous Improvement 1 466 are there any additional questions or comments around the self-evaluation

[00:45:00]
all right so this gives us a total of 19 points on the south evaluation for the last quarter what we believe is possible for our next evaluation in the next quarter is 46 points so at this time I will entertain a motion and consideration of our quarterly self-evaluation I will move to accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 19 points on the student outcomes Focus governance self-evaluation instrument thank you we have a second I have a second this is Courtney thank you we have a motion for member of store and a second from Member Jackson to accept our quarterly South

[00:51:00]
do they have from other students so different community involvements that you know that we had a lot that were volunteer at food banks and there was some that actually had things that they created so those types of differences that we looked at you so yeah if you want to add anything no I mean we did talk about trying to aim for more diversity and decided actually that just based on everything that member of Astoria said that the top three were what we thought were the top three hopefully that answers thank you are there other questions or emotion I will move to prove the aps nominee for the New Mexico School Board Association 2024 student scholarship this is Courtney this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion from a member Jackson and a second from Member popular Romero Miss King can we have a roll call vote please now stop

[00:53:00]
an Sr update or FY 2500 timeline a 10-year enrollment Trend or 25 Bud items on our radar and FY 2525 budget presentations for the student family and Community Sports Department Title 1 depart and language cultural Language and Cultural equity and title 3 Department next so first up is our FY 2400 versus actual you'll see that I'm sorry 24 operation for this year we do it on we have to give projected enrollment quite early and what we usually do is use our 120 day

[00:54:00]
Roman numbers of the current year for a projections and when we were building this year's budget we used FY 23s 120 day enrollment and we reduced that number by 2% but unfortunately that reduction was not enough because our decline ended up being a 5% so what he does at certain times throughout the budget year they look at our you know they look at our budget numbers and they made an adjustment and this adjustment resulted in a 2.5 million dollar reduction in our seg so you will be seeing that coming we just wanted to give it you know let you guys know that will be coming in April 24th finance committee meeting and you'll see that through the bars that we have so next

[00:55:00]
so in our FY 24 operation on restricted you see the budget versus actual and I have those blue arrows indicating that those are the two areas that you'll see the effect of this 2.5 million reduction and so even though our balance right now at this time of 3:15 was 56 it really is like 54 because of that 2.5 million reduction but you'll see that on our updated version for next month and then the next we have our phones update so this is really looking good cuz we have encumbered or already expense 93% of ours are funds and that is a $242 million budgets so yeah we have been keeping everybody on track keeping in touch with every Department making sure you know

[00:56:00]
are you able to spend are you on track is everything going well and if not you know we kind of readjust as needed but everybody seems to be moving right along so that's great news next we have just are FY 25 operation timeline and you can see it kind of shows what we've gone through already where we're at tonight is the presentations for the student family community services the title one else three and then what will have coming up in the next month and then next is kind of showing that funded enrollment projection as you can see we just can continue to this is 10 years on the final one is projected and we just continue to see the decrease and I think in the prior presentation we had shown some

[00:57:00]
Mason data on that and so we see that we will continue to decrease in the next few years hopefully not as much as we've seen but our protection is not quite as drastic as we saw this year so that's kind of sad that news but it's happening Nationwide so we're not on we're not the only ones and then we have some next we have items that were calling on our radar and and what these are are kind of purchases that were purchased and paid for with a serf ones that we have identified as kind of that we still want to find these if possible and so we kind of have them and then there's some that we have to do like the first one the 3% celery increase for all employees you know we're definitely doing that and we're definitely continuing on the

[00:58:00]
with our unrestricted funds some of these other items we're hoping that we can find alternative funding sources for the Panorama software and paper tutoring and then we'll also probably have to take the Fine Arts expansion the Final Phase in operational and it's not funded this for this current year are expansion we got an increase in our factor which helped pay for the increase this current budget year but we didn't get any change in the factor this year so that whole final expansion will be we just will be on us only and with that I will pass it to Ronettes thank you Google

[00:59:00]
to the board concerning the FY 2501 presentation is first apartment it is student family community supports next as you can see they have a projected budget of 76.2 million it consist of operational federal funds and you see that little sliver of city and county Bundy next here we have the phone number the guard rails next section is the operational budget is projected at 34.5

[01:00:00]
support students mental and physical needs and a concentrates on the wraparound Services we also have on the slide the scope and the allowable use of funds next operational funds as you see in this slide are primarily personnel and some contract to Services next expenditures include school counselors School nurses school health systems attendance support social workers which Target the schools with the highest chronic option the clothing bank and family engagement next I'm here are the

[01:01:00]
s o f t questions so you'll see that you know this operational will be taking the 3% increase in employee pay their strategies include implementation of wraparound services that align to the board's goals and guardrails also what are they changing their insurance counselors and nurses work together with the attendance team to improve attendance of students that will contribute to goals one two and three and are they using anything different no change these primarily for stop at schools which are nurses counselors and they want to continue supporting these next these are the federal funds at the Department please

[01:02:00]
spell funds are 4.5 million odds are also used for mental and physical health related needs the scope is the student family community supports division they work together with a scope of old child whole school and whole Community approach These funds are the Medicaid phones so we want to make sure that we use the funds as dictated by Medicaid next this is a breakdown of funds you can see that the highest is personal and other so too describe what is in the other support clothing bank

[01:03:00]
private schools and Reserve next and here are some examples of expenditures and how they are related to the goals in the guard rails again you see School nurses which we use rated funds with the operational family engagement staff attendance supporters and out of school time before and after school supplies next again you see that the 3% legislative increase our strategy is to continue to implement strategies at school sites

[01:04:00]
how are they using them different the behaviors are being trained through the office of equity School nurses are training to align their services also to bowls and guard rooms next to you have the budget for title one so the the budget is 37.5 million and the purpose of this of these phones are to allow schools the opportunity to meet the needs of high poverty students for this from proficiency the scope of this is the intent of the scope is to work using the title 1 funds to support direct instruction to students to meet the high expectations of the state standards

[01:05:00]
buns as you'll see in the distribution are used for salaries benefits by been substitutes professional development other Contract Services and supplies and materials next so the breakdown again the largest portion here is is direct flow to school sites the funds are budgeted at the schools instead of at the district level and then the next of course is the personnel and this graph the I graph shows the distribution of one that align to the goals and the guard rails next so here are some examples of how these funds are being used for goal for the mckinney-vento program has 23 stuff which provide about 3580 students in 2000

[01:06:00]
or experiencing homelessness and it also provides funds for interventionists at the schools it provides direct support for those as mentioned earlier from farthest from proficiency at schools and with a 75% poverty percentage or higher professional development for those interventionists and District support to using Martinez identified subgroups we continue on with more examples instructional programs MPD or program implementation and instructional support for Albuquerque breeds at 3 elementary schools read 180 Middle High in charter schools Math 180 Middle High in charter schools and out of school time program and also for

[01:07:00]
continue with more examples they also provide funding for Community School development direct support and professional development they have additional events and programs to enhance learning through family and Community engagement such as explora family nights story time in the park adult basic education and contract with shine partnership for family financial literacy programs they also provide alternative transportation for foster care next so now we get to the question is the budget expected to increase and it's going to mostly remain flat expenditures are expected to increase their strategy is to distribute funds by rank order

[01:08:00]
using the same for people amount from this current fiscal year resulting in schools only seeing a change in funding due to enrollment changes or poverty percentage increase or decrease and then what is changing and there will be funds for AP and CT type classes and how are they using them different Title One middle and high school district interventionist using early warning system indicators to work with students identified through that system and back to rent it thank you the next department is Language and Cultural equity and title 3 next total budget is 4.99

[01:09:00]
5% state next this is a pie graph that shows the alignment to goals and guardrails next on this budget breakdown you can see the highest to go teachers software on tracks professional development textbooks etcetera next on the operational side the purpose is to fulfill the bilingual program at the school they provide support to classrooms period we have some expenditures period

[01:10:00]
bilingual endorsed teachers that support the schools they provide professional development curriculum integration also the department collaborates with other departments to ensure material systems and PD are distributed equitably next they do have consultants and they make sure to have meaningful communication with parents next again they have the percent of employee includes the provide instructional materials professional development translation interpretation for students in the bilingual programs they're going any

[01:11:00]
shoes are they're going to increase their School site visits to better support staff and students how they're using them differently is there a using Sabbath which is a new curriculum you're going to train the staff and roll it out to the students next this is the federal portion the title 3 this is part A it is a supplemental support for English learning programs and services the scope is to improve the English language proficiency and academic achievements it can be used for level appropriate General Supply software technology next week's certified teacher's

[01:12:00]
and a help with professional development help model lessons and support curriculum integration next again if there's any stop we have to do the 3% employee the funds are used to support a strategy that provides the instructional materials the PD and any other supports for the alignment of curriculum to English Learners what are they changing they're doing better alignment of PD development into support recommend student needs and again what are they doing different and it's the Sabbath so with that we started thank you for the presentation

[01:13:00]
directions down the line from members of the board I just wanted to acknowledge that we do have May 29th set as the day for approval of the budget so we do have one more budget presentation prior to that the goal of all of these monthly presentations is to get all of our questions answered so that we can go into that May 29th session feeling confident that the budget presented to us is aligned to our goals and guardrails in the district strategic plan and importantly that we're making the best use of our budget in order to help improve student outcomes and so just sort of putting that out there who remember we have one more opportunity for the back and forth information seeking as well as obviously over email to get information so with that I'll just go ahead and start to my right with member benefits with any questions you have about the budget presentation don't have any questions but thank you for a very comprehensive and easy to understand presentation thank you member Jackson a couple

[01:14:00]
hey so so my first question is in regards to let me ask my biggest question first so in regards to like the title 1 funding so for the 20% of schools that are not receiving Title One what assurances can you give that the students needs in those schools are being met in alignment with guardrail to from the funding perspective so as you have seen and you will see even with the next presentations we have a lot of different funding sources and so one of the additional funding sources is at risk funds those are in the unrestricted funds and so when we have those funds those go directly to all schools not

[01:15:00]
just a 75% so that's distributed to all to 100% of the schools I hope that answers your question also in the operational funds that is above the line those also also on enrollment and we also do compliance when school starts so we're able to see what the schools might need additionally that in our projections we might not have captured so we also have those buns and when we do that compliance that could also help the schools with needs that arise and and that compliance that happens at the beginning of school like August or like after a certain like first 30-day counter usually goes on until after Labor

[01:16:00]
because we still have changes after Labor Day okay so if there's like a change in enrollment or a change in particular needs of students that come into the school that wasn't expected at the beginning of the year there's a compliance issue that occurs where students can be met yeses sometimes even with moving from one

[01:17:00]
school to another where some will come from this school and move to another one and now this one is thrown above thresholds of our funding formula and so yes that's what we do we right away see when they're those kids are in the seats we look at those numbers and if they need them we go through a compliance process which gives them those additional ft and it can be you know EA's or teachers and then and that happens so also just across the district as a whole yes it happens to all all schools all levels right okay and so that risk funds are those are given to all the schools and so the schools that do not receive the additional Title 1 funding use the address funding to support the needs that they have in that school period so my second question is

[01:18:00]
what kind of particular to paper and just as a little background I tried to use paper for my daughter after hours and tried four times and could not get in so my question is and it's in related to the answers we would like to see an increase in usage my question is how are you going to is the paper person here how are you going to work to increase usage both within the schools and is it a good use of funding and how do we know that those people who do not have a direct line to the superintendent to say why the heck isn't this working how do we know that those parents are and those students are able to access after school in after hours at like say 9:00 when your child can do algebra

[01:19:00]
Choice Gormley will answer that question thanks Miss coralie I guess my big question is is it is it being used when we only have one big Costco size of a pie right of resources is it really being used in the way that we want it to be used to address do now comes I can hear you Chief academic officer that those are great questions because there's we have not had that experience since I've talked to you or since it came out in the past and so we really need to find out what where's the technical glitch because the permissions

[01:20:00]
are there and I haven't heard this issue with another family that doesn't mean it's not happening but possibly we could follow up with the 30,000 parents that gave their consent to a school messenger asking if they're if they need technical assistance so that's one thing we can do and looking at the data I've noticed at 50 schools have not participated in initial training and so we need to Target those schools and find out why they haven't been why they haven't reached out to papers we have a full-time customer service specialist that goes to schools and provides the training papers also looking to hire a second full-time customer service specialist to help ensure that the teachers and administrators are changed on the use another thing that we're doing is paper is recently added another service called paper reading and it's a

[01:21:00]
play I type of intervention but in a meeting today with paper and the person who developed this it is aligned with the science of reading very strongly it looks like a very good reading support for students and so we're hoping to train principles on that sometime in April to let them know that's available I am hoping that next year when families have to do their enrollment that consent peace will come up automatically so that it's a one and done process because the tutors are not in New Mexico parents have to consent to usage because they can't become here to be background check and that's a requirement of our district that we that we provide all the background checks so we're hoping that that process then but 30,000 is a pretty good number since we purchased 50,000 I believe licenses so licenses for every third

[01:22:00]
do 12th grade students we are continually seeing an increase I just looked yesterday at the data and our numbers for after hours use have tripled like from one week to the prior week on average it's still not high and it's not being used and so we need to figure out why why it's not being used and how we can increase that if 30,000 families have provided consent why is it not being used yeah absolutely and I certainly let me just I did not want this to be like me particular having an issue but I think what it highlights is that if I'm having an issue how how many other parents are all students are also having issues that can't just make a phone call right and give up frankly I mean I haven't gone this isn't about me but as a portrait I haven't gone back because I was like

[01:23:00]
forget it I don't want to try so my point is is if this is an expenditure that you're looking at that is going to be in addition especially when we're seeing a decrease in enrollment and we're seeing increases other places that it might need to be used I just really want to make sure that this expenditure is directly improving our student outcomes and is being used so it sounds like some of the things that you're going to do is get consent upon and enrollment and it looks like you're going to reach out to the 50 school to see why they have not participated yet and you are continuing to meet with them to discuss with paper reading for science of reading so there are you you do still feel strongly that this is a good use of funds I may be able to look at the whole student interaction with the tutor and I'm

[01:24:00]
very impressed with the way I see tutors responding to students I went I visited a district in Florida who have implemented high dosage tutoring through a digital platform and compare I don't even remember who it was but it was very much a tutor telling the student with the next step for providing support and answers whereas what's great about papers it's a very kind of Socratic method it lets it makes a student think about like what they're seeing what the questions answering what they know already and so just telling them what the next step is I think you may have seen that I got to look at a student's interaction with paper it was a two-hour interaction from when they started to when they signed off the students stayed on with paper and actually went

[01:25:00]
never had to leave because they're 8-hour session was up and another came on and so had I not been able to witness the responses from tutor I may not be as encouraged as I am but so far paper is extremely responsive to our needs and they're doing everything that we request and so we just need to keep in contact with them and then there's also an opportunity to look at look at how we might be able to reduce the cost of this program and look at maybe her activity instead of an overall General license so we're looking at different options on possibility of reducing the overall cost of paper

[01:26:00]
thank you my question might be more of a just clarification question to the presentation so initially when you started the presentation we talked about that there will be a decrease but as we went through the presentation we saw that there were increases was it specifically because you were only giving a presentation on Title One title 3 sfcs so that's why we saw the increase of the 2.9 and the 1% but overall we have a decrease in my understanding that right correct so our decrease overall is mostly our operational budget but we are seeing a lot of the other Grant funds also staying very flat or possibly also and so in one of them like you you may have seen that it look like there's a 0% increase in the same but they have to absorb that 3% increase within their end the reason why we have to look at this holistically and

[01:27:00]
you look at that because ours is going down and when grants in the past have gone down operational sometimes has to cover those things right now we're we're at a point where is if grants cannot absorb them we can't either and so so we look at those so overall it is going down and it could possibly affect the rest but yeah that there's all each source is has different some are growing some are staying flat some are decreasing along with operational but overall which the biggest budget the operational is decreasing okay okay when we talked about the first decrease the 2.5 that's for FY 2220

[01:28:00]
525 got it all the way FY 2525 is awesome we may come back around on this member Astoria I have a couple clarifying questions and then I have a question so I'll do that one first so looking at the graph on the LCD entitled 3 budget breakdown there's a very tiny sliver for supplies and materials I'm guessing so what other methods are you using to try and supplement that because I know we're doing new softwares we have new instructional coaches things like that how are we going to be able to afford the materials that they need in order for those to be you know you're referencing which page 30

[01:29:00]
Madden president members of the board member of Stargate I'll take a stab at trying to answer that question it's a very good one and part of the answer lies in instructional materials for example was cited in this presentation a service specifically that those materials come out of instructional materials out of a different department yet lce is supplementing offering professional development and support for that curriculum as the overall District wide materials so they're not having to use buns from their specific budget to pay for those materials cuz they're coming from other sources from throughout the district that's just one example that may be highlights a response to your question exactly

[01:30:00]
and if I may I just have a couple of clarifying you talked about increasing the amount of social workers for attendance would those be full-time position social workers or are they part-time what does that look like good evening Gonzales so you know I'm not sure that those decisions have been made in terms of what the exact positions would look like we're really in a space of this is my new phrase radical alignment and how we begin to think about not just the FTE but more specifically how they're used I would believe probably I mean we know just in terms of hiring practices that a full-time FTE is easier

[01:31:00]
I fell in a part-time but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be agile in the approach thank you yeah I'm just excited to see that that's part of our budget because that is something that not only teachers and staff but students really want to see at their schools so hopefully we can start increasing and hiring those full-time positions so thank you my last one was about the School nurses and changing some of their methods to I guess being with Gulf War I just was hoping you guys can give me an example of what they're doing now versus what they're going to try doing so I can kind of get a vision of what that looks like sure I can address that thank you so I've been actually really excited by this work led by senior director Brubaker the nursing department so really she's led the nurses in to talking specifically about those skills habits in mindsets and how that conversation can happen

[01:32:00]
when they come into the nursing office and so through our student information system the nurses are documenting the work that they're doing you know the meeting notes I'm not a nurse I'm not really sure how to talk about all that but they they do a lot of documentation and in that documentation they might also take note of Sherry came into the nurses office today she was feeling like she really couldn't get her homework done feeling a lot of anxiety we had some conversations about perseverance and so will be in to collect sort of that information at a large you know sort of General scale about how our nurses begin to influence skills habits in my sets so thank you for that question I think it's great work to highlight thank you thank you remember tomaricho yes my question is on a page 18 under the Federal Way budget for the federal family engagement

[01:33:00]
steffel aligned strategies to provide coaching and technical assistance to increase family engagement and targeted populations identified in gold one two and three I'll wait till you get there Target population are you specifically talking about the parents and their issues particularly pertaining to Gold literacy math and post-secondary thank you for that question I think that's an important I guess clarification because it's both and we definitely are always looking at our subgroup data and making decisions and and

[01:34:00]
is based on that but just looking across the board I don't have to tell you every school Community is really unique and different and so you know the strategies that we put in place for family engagement truly try to take that into account what the community assets are that they're bringing into the school and how we really leverage those so that's kind of a very high level but I think it's because it's so nuanced and the family engagement support is really working on how do we get to root cause analysis and then using that data to have Community Driven solutions that really begin to support our students in their outcomes so what does a coaching in the technical assistance going to look like pertaining to those goals you know I can tell you more like what it has looked like I think we're very much in a development phase on how we continue to keep that process agile I just think about

[01:35:00]
how quickly students seem to be changing and that's true for families too so we do have a training that we offer is called Step I would have to defer I believe it's in the notes maybe and it was in the questions cuz I cannot remember what the acronym stands for but it is an engagement training and so I think you know that's a good foundation to start with and to see you know what are the key principles that are being put forth there but then again getting to that more nuanced approach would be how we would be getting to shift it I think there's opportunity to leverage not only family engagements staff but also our community school coordinators they're really key players in that work and you know we want to build on on their connections in the community as well and they had one more on the same page you have behaviors in elementary school what are we doing for Middle School in high school for those

[01:36:00]
thank you for that question we do have some middle schools who have sort of I guess piloted doing redirector but along those lines I don't think we have that program per se exists at the secondary level Middle School specifically we have leaned into classroom culture training and so really digging into some best practices about how we manage our classrooms so that ideally students aren't escalating right and so we have consistency we have patience we have restorative practices happening the high schools many of them have heard of that training they're like I would like to get some of that sounds really great and so we are looking at how we would expand that I think there are also perhaps other resources that go into secondary and probably the budget people could explain it better right but

[01:37:00]
they get assistant principals they sometimes have money to pay for Deans ews coordinators and so they're leveraging those types of supports to do work similar to what a behavior with you thank you thank you remember Dominguez thank you I'm going to reference 23 of 37 slide 23 and it's in the second row go one two and three interventionists that are being budgeted 96696 schools to provide direct support to students for this from proficiency at schools with a 75% poverty percentage or higher I'm trying to square this information with

[01:38:00]
the response to a question about how many schools are in need of math interventionists and how many have access to them it says in the answer that we aim to collaborate closely with teachers to guarantee that students are exposed to grade level content and not diverted into separate math intervention classes outside of their Core Curriculum and so the way it's answered here it's an either or situation right and I'm not entirely sure that is that the reality because we want to invest is that a good strategy

[01:39:00]
some clarification I think is is an order give me or you Gonzalez that's an excellent question and it seems like you've been in our office over the last week or so because we've been having that exact conversation that we have had and it has been one that has been brought up to us by our recent visit by the Council of great City schools in regards to the role of interventionists play and how we capitalize on that work District why to have impact a line to Kohl's and some of the conversations in relationship to that is how do we support our interventionists so we do have a Cadence of accountability with monthly meetings were interventionists come together they hear on common

[01:40:00]
strategies a common approach but we've also recognized that there are some gaps who are the people that are supporting the interventionists is it a line system-wide do we have LCD at the table do we have special ed at the table do we have curriculum and instruction at the table are triangulated so we have a universal methodology in support of our interventionists who are then going into the schools and I think that goes to the response is really supporting our teachers to be the primary interventionist for their students ideally at layer one level moving into the different layers of support so that we do not have situations where we have pull out models but we take students away from their primary classroom and their primary first teach so this is an area we are dare I say excited about

[01:41:00]
we are definitely looking at I'm going to have follow-up meetings to discuss this very concept and I'm no remember to bring us you were not in the meeting but I think you might have been channeling the energy of the conversation so am I hearing you correctly that previously at what levels I think you may have seen that model of some schools and the desire is to tighten that up and I'll post it further is to evaluate that program and see if that program indeed is if we're having to return on the investment so we're that serious about this specific work because you are absolutely right it is a big chunk it is a big investment is the in

[01:42:00]
give me in the right place to do the desired work and the kids getting what they need right I just had a question so I know I know that some schools report at last year reported back to me Med schools that were very proud about the increase in their math scores and it was due to their thinking of an interventionist my impression was it was a separate or an additional additional help not during math class

[01:43:00]
so how do we if we're getting good results like that how do we is that the kind of analysis you're doing now board member Dominguez president Gonzalez board member Dominguez not knowing the Nuance of that specific situation might wear my mind goes first is that may have been a school allocated interventionist working on a specific task perhaps in their 90-day plan I don't know and based on their budget call which they've just submitted within the last several weeks they may have had to make some tough decisions in regards to this versus that and some of those conversations are Dynamic and difficult to be able to reconcile a balanced budget that they've been back to the budget office for eventually approval by board those are definitely tough conversations because I'm just going to

[01:44:00]
what channel what potentially was also at the table at that conversation is support for social emotional learning or an educational assistant or somebody that may be focuses on ews so it's really all of the moving parts that are part of the dynamic conversation that comes to schools Every Spring as they submit their budgets in regards to priorities but pushing schools to have aligned priorities in response to the work of the district in our goals and gargles thank you because if what came to mind immediately is concerned for our newcomers

[01:45:00]
I think it was as we were approaching December 2023 they were loud and clear that they need help in order to help their kids and so a resource like paper where where is the you know where is the accommodation for the kind of population that we have and if we are a school district of 69,000 Kids One customer service rep I think we need two or three and certainly you know the cost what we need from from the company

[01:46:00]
related to paper and and this problem let me get back to my question another question so how long is this license good for and when did the clock start ticking and do we get reprieve until we get the access situation results in the presentation on the docket for consideration for continued funding what we have asked as assistant superintendent has alluded to her

[01:47:00]
previously is how can we look at the data the times in which it's being used for example and really use the data to drive and ask and the ask is perhaps we're going to modify the hours it's used the days that it's used to reduce the overall spend to something perhaps more reasonable and targeted to our specific reality here in APS so we are looking at the data to ask for a proposal that we can consider for next school year one has not been entered into for next school year at this point we're going to ask how is the

[01:48:00]
how do they measure activity on on the software on online activity is it how many problems got solved or is it strictly Time online because that might include trying to get access and they're counting that as usage which is would be inappropriate but I mean those details are things I wonder about how are they how is usage measured and does assistant superintendent she has texted me that our current contract goes to August so it doesn't end at the school year ends at the beginning of next and I think we're getting into some of the very Tactical

[01:49:00]
I just want to be mindful that we are trying to glean all of the information we can to make this high-level decision around trade-offs and Roi aligned to our goals and guard rails and so what I heard from Dr Gonzalez is that assessment audit Roi work is happening and I think there's just sort of a clarifying question on exactly what we know about how well papers working now but I think knowing that you're doing the ROI analysis is important but if you could just respond to that quickly as you can get we have a portal that we can look up exactly how many different activities are provided with in anytime period so we can look at a week we can look at the deception we can see how many live tutoring sessions have been we can see how many

[01:50:00]
writing responsive has been submitted with feedback we can see which schools have the greatest use so we get a pretty good finite number of activities broken down by the type of Activity thank you if I can add real quickly I just opened up the email with the questions and thank you you did provide a report of all of those numbers in the total activities so if anybody is interested in what that looks like that is on the the document that was sent out thank you so I have a couple of questions and then we can Circle back around if there's more mine I think we're again primarily related to this question of how do we know what's working and if you could describe any strategic trade-offs or strategic abandonments maybe this is a question for folks who aren't here but better being made as a result of our

[01:51:00]
is there anything that we are actually changing or cutting as a result of sosg cuz as I look through the presentation it is a lot of stay the same stay the same remain flat no changes that the main changes noted by member top Romero is the 3% Personnel increase so I think we considered continue to have this issue of personnel costs increasing while enrollment is decreasing and that's just the wrong direction where we're going for our budget and so have there been any strategic and abandonments strategic trade-offs in our budget president Gonzalez members of the board there has been a deep desire to get guidance on that very point and we are anxiously waiting as the board knows we invited the Council of great City Schools to Albuquerque they were here in

[01:52:00]
play March I believe for a strategic support visit where they met with the directors of every Department we're talking about tonight and many others who really have questions about return on investment duplication of services alignment strategic alignment and really giving us a critical eye being a critical friend and making a set of recommendations that we are able to better align the support to schools via the department via the district in a way that is aligned to the goals of the district in other words being bullied to have some tough conversations some tough adjustments to really be able to take the work of our goals and guardrails to the next level of work to really ensure that are alignment

[01:53:00]
response to schools is coherent and is aligned I'll just pick family engagement was discussed tonight well one can make an argument that everybody in the district should be engaged in family engagement in one way or another the question comes into play how do we do that so that we are best supporting our schools and users are principals and teachers to be that ancient of support to our families and part of that involves a through line between the different departments that offer support in that area so that we get to as close to a consistent response from the different departments to the end user being the schools on how to engage in a successful model of family engagement for our community the report from the council is due to us later this month I will not presume to speak for the incoming superintendent who will then use it

[01:54:00]
take us to the next level of work but I do know that we at greatly anticipate that and that is just one response that I know she has other she's Discerning several other pieces as she on board her new role thank you for that that's really helpful to know the timeline as well because the time line was my other question my last one that hasn't been answered is just how are principles using progress monitoring to allocate their staff and resources sort of a follow-up to member dominguez's question around this math interventionist so if I'm a school principal and I'm trying to decide between attendance support math Interventional is behavior support whatever how to what extent does the progress monitoring or even the walk through data that you've completed recently come into play in those conversations

[01:55:00]
president Gonzalez that's an excellent question and there's a few things that come to mind initially as I kind of discern a response to it in the first one is how is the work of progress monitoring informing the school's 90-day plan and how is that then driving the Staffing decisions that should be budgeted and executed accordingly and I think that will become a very individual site by site conversation based on the data we will undoubtedly have commonalities District wide base on statistical peer schools based on initiatives based on schools that may be Community Schools in their response to how they do some of this work but the expectation I would I know as the principal supervisors work with their schools is what is that alignment after every

[01:56:00]
progress monitoring meeting here the very next principle meeting is essentially the same thing with the principles so they are getting the data at a district level we are then working with them to drill down that data to their school level and then working with our SAS team to be able to assist them to really get granular to the micro level in how they build and develop their 90-day plan with their 30-day check-in to be able to inform themselves ideally and hopefully it's becoming common language or we're moving to a place where it's becoming common language to where schools are being able to not wonder when it comes to budget call season what are we going to do and how are we going to line their work rather it's a coherent kind of month to month conversation as the 90-day plan being the driver for that conversation great thank you for that and then just a comment that I I think when we

[01:57:00]
we started this process we acknowledge that really truly aligning the budget to the goals and guardrails and the Strategic plan is like a 3-year process and so I think some of the work that you're talking about sounds super awesome and I want to be like so that's going to be done in May but I also realize we've got a ways to go and so that's also a reminder for myself as much as it is for the rest of the board are there any additional questions on the budget I have seen that there is a minimum of 0.5 nurses and counselors at every school I'm concerned at what that might look like for students who might be feeling sick at a time when there's not a nurse so what are we doing in those other times when we don't have that or president Gonzalez

[01:58:00]
remember Astoria thank you for that question again I want to highlight senior director Brubaker because she's actually has a really thoughtful way that she makes sure we have health coverage at every school every day part of that strategy is through Health assistance who can do many of the things that a nurse can do with supervision you know so if a child isn't feeling well they need a place to lie down we have an adult who's carrying in there to take care of them make a phone call home the other strategy that she has deployed that I've been really impressed with is partner nurses basically so there are cohorts of nurses who are organized geographically in the city so if I'm a nurse and I'm going to be out I know that there are other nurses close by that could be called on so I believe the system is a little more complex than that but in general it's a really thoughtful way to make

[01:59:00]
that exactly the concern you're bringing forward is addressed thank you I'm going to have one more thing I was with the help of the chair of the committee for add haha I would love to invite your team to come and sit with us because we're talking about family engagement and ways that we can be just more welcoming to family so it would be great to be on the same page across the district and what that looks like so yeah we can talk about it and hopefully have a conversation with that looks like thank you for that I think we would enjoy that and I agree on the more aligned we are in our messaging our approaches the more successful we're going to be so thank you and it's really fun committees sorry I did I'm sorry I think it's probably just a statement again it's all so it goes back to the first the first page where there's still some things that have to be decided because funding has run out

[02:00:00]
in regards to Fine Arts promises were made right about the Fine Arts expansion and as we are looking at promises that have been discussed and made as to this was going to be a 5-year-old out just think that we need to write we're working on trust we're working on communication and it's it's important that we have to keep our word the district has to keep their word and so I that's just a statement I want to throw out there it is not a suggestion it's just a statement that we're working on trust and we're working on keeping our word on what we say we're going to do so that's it thank you for that number Jackson I just want to acknowledge just sort of connect the dot between this and the time you see evaluation is we're shifting how we use our time but also how we do the budget how we get the presentations and so it is helpful to have the

[02:01:00]
budget PowerPoint presentation in advance if we could have it in advance when we get our full materials packet that we have the same deadline to be able to submit questions in our goal is to submit questions on the budget presentation as well so it's just a reminder to board members if you could submit all of your questions on the budget whether technical or tactical that will help us stay out of some of the details that we were getting into in this meeting if we can try to keep those to the best of our ability in email so that sort of the two-way street is that we need the materials far enough in advance so we can do the questions so that we could get the answers but also I think signaling the Strategic questions is helpful too so that the administration is able to respond appropriately so if there are some questions that are maybe not tactical in nature I think we asked a lot of strategic questions for example the doctor Gonzalez was thankful to answer because he's sitting in the seat today

[02:02:00]
but also just be mindful of of that make sure that we get our questions in and again that last plug that this may presentation is going to be the last presentation we have on the budget before our final approval in May 29th obviously we can ask questions if that May 29th meeting as well but that's not a point where we're going to go back and ask for new information or something that we haven't asked for so just encourage the board to think about that as you think about what information you're going to need to be able to vote on the budget so that we can make sure we're getting that and that may session and so with that we will move on to agenda item 9 thank you to our presenters for that presentation on the budget and we're looking forward to the ongoing budget presentations our next item on the agenda is the president's report so I have a couple of big bullets and a couple of details underneath each of them one is I just wanted to comment on superintendent Elders leave

[02:03:00]
mama just make sure that everyone knows that we sent an email out to all senior staff with an APS this week just to let them know again that superintendent Elder has chosen to take leave for the remainder of his contract which is through June 30th so given that superintendent Elder is on leave Dr Blakey is serving as the Acting Superintendent which means that she does have complete authority to make all decisions on behalf of the district so I think we've been in a little bit of a weird transition point with superintendent Elders still under contract but having an Acting Superintendent so just want to clarify that superintendent Elder is now officially on leave superintendent Acting Superintendent Blakey does have the authority to make decisions and we will still see superintendent Elder around so he is on leave but he will be around at the aps Education Foundation gold bargain which is on April 19th for that hope everyone attends

[02:04:00]
and he'll also be representing the district that many of the graduation ceremonies in May so you'll see him around however he is on extended leave and I also just want to say that we will be planning a reception for him before the June 5th board meeting at the Epps administration building so we will have an opportunity to record it to recognize superintendent Elder prior to his transition and the end of his contract on June 30th with respect to student outcomes governance I just want to again applaud the board members all of us for the great progress that we've made over the course of the last quarter which is particularly significant our coach reminded me because we have three completely new members so even as four of us have been doing this for a year and a half and have had a chance to get our feet wet a little bit and to learn we've had three folks come in completely new and all so just demonstrated a very significant progress as well so big kudos to the board for that and

[02:05:00]
and if you like student outcomes Focus governance you're in for a big tree on April 17th our next meeting cuz it's going to be almost all student outcomes Focus confidence so please take time to prepare we're going to have a lot of materials again we'll have a deadline for submitting those questions please submit Those Questions by the deadline please seeking assistance if you need it prior to the deadline so what we're going to have is we will have the gold to monitoring reports that we were taking from March 20th so we will get all of that information coming to us as well and it's going to include data interpretation and more charts as we saw on the actual meeting so that's going to come through so please take a look at that all say that it's our hope that we approve goal to without additional discussion or without significant discussion so please again get all of those questions in in advance

[02:06:00]
while Dr Mikey has stepped in and is now are Acting Superintendent we have to remember that her contract doesn't officially begin until July 1st so she is not being evaluated yet based on these reports she will have a full Year's worth of reports before her first formal evaluation so just wanted to clarify that as well there was some confusion around why we tabled gold too and why we had not tabled similar reports in the past so it's just a reminder that again part of continuous Improvement is the farther along we get the higher the bar is set the higher the expectation so in many respects we have been practicing for the last year and a half certainly for the last three months with our new board members and so now we're really transitioning out of practice phase and really trying to move forward to to really do this the right way so it's a good thing that the report was tabled and in particular because student outcomes is our driving force

[02:07:00]
we've all agreed that that's why we're here that's why the district exists and so if the data or the narrative doesn't clearly show that student outcomes are improving it is our responsibility to ask why so we do expect board members to ask why and to demand additional information so that is our responsibility that is why we were elected and so I know it feels awkward on both sides but just remembering again the improving student outcomes is the whole reason we're all here and that's our community made that clear as well so just coming back to that that these goals and reels were set by our community and that's what we're elected to do so in addition to go to we will also have gold three monitoring which will be at the April 17th meeting as well now that we are sharing responsibility for facilitating these progress monitoring sessions board member Jackson will be leading that session so board members should receive the reports for that

[02:08:00]
Nursery monitoring session later this week and again you'll need to submit your Technical and Technical questions in advance that's going to be by Monday April 9th 5:00 p.m. remember Jackson will play a role in coordinating with Miss King around review of those questions review of those questions and also coordinating with myself and the administration around the actual report so we're working on what that looks like sort of the template for the process for for that but that's going to be happening as well and again another plug to reach out to your coach if you need assistance the next comes focused topic that's on our April 17th agenda is the annual targets so we discussed that in the context of our sfg evaluation so also on April 17th the administration will provide both the annual goal Targets in their room gold targets that we've asked for

[02:09:00]
and I just want to acknowledge the staff and Dr Blakey for working on this and and for getting it to us so that we can move ahead with our progress monitoring also related to sosg I told you you got to love it is community outreach and so we did conduct Community engagement where we went out to the community in the months of January and February for the months of March 8th April and May we are doing community outreach where we are going to community events so it's a plug that if a community organization is out there and would like to invite members from the board to join a meeting to hear their perspectives to hear their concerns or to share information that's a top priority in each board member is expected to do community outreach during the months of March April and May and will include more details on exactly how you track that in our weekly update email and then the last thing I just also we only

[02:10:00]
add four speakers for public forum tonight other nights we've had more speakers sometimes we do hear themes and what we're hearing from our public forum comments and so I just wanted to acknowledge that we are hearing those things we are listening and we are responding and so while we can't address the concerns during the meeting due to the open meetings act We are following up so we have asked the administration to look into the issues that have been brought to our attention during public comment so recently these have included the belt about schedule right-sizing concerns Middle School Reform tobacco policy and all acknowledge we heard today around PE in physical education so just want to acknowledge for the public that we are responding to your concerns that we're hearing in the public forum and that completes the president's report as well as our meeting so the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday April 17th at the sfg heavy

[02:11:00]
meeting at 5:00 p.m. here in Dallas and Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live streamed at aps.edu and without the meeting is adjourned
