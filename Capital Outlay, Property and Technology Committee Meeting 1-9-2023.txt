[00:02:00]
yes yes Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes Crystal Tapia Romero yes Jackson

[00:03:00]
Kaelyn fennel APS senior planner and manager of the capital master plan Rosalinda Montoya APS executive director of budget and Julian Hicks APS senior director of budget and those are the members that have been working on this committee for the past few months and just some history before we go into the details of the recommendations is in 2015 we started the right size committee here in the school district and in 2016 was the first presentation to the school board to go over findings of the right size committee the Committee created a technical methodology and intention of operating more efficiently as a district while at the same time in high academic outcomes and quality of academic offerings as we go through the information in front of you you should all have with you we want to remind you that this is a right-sizing recommendation right size is a term that is adopted to ensure that the district remain

[00:04:00]
spell academically and financially viable will also ensure that equity and access are maintained to all of our families what you'll see in the report today is the recommendations to keep up with changing District needs as well as state and federal educational mandates to operate cost effectively and efficiently while at the same time ensuring High academic outcomes and the quality of academic offerings mitigating the rising marginal costs of operating the districts reversing the student enrollment losses by enhancing and maintaining quality of offerings as well as expanding academic variety which you'll see in some of the recommendations to actually increase enrollment and being proactive in order to facilitate for new Universal Early Childhood learning mandates with the Early Childhood expansion and with that I'd like to turn it over to mister to go over the right size and rubric in the world

[00:05:00]
thank you very much members of the board superintendent Elder the committee starting 5 years ago came up with what we call the bike sizing rubric or variables as to how we shall go about doing this before you if you look on page three variables are and to summarize them we looked at 6:55 and Rome School enrollment school capacity transfer Transit patterns for

[00:06:00]
every individual school that was the third variable the urban zoning trends of the School's attendance area that is the fourth and this is an interesting variable because attendance areas of schools have changed over time their schools that were only residential in the attendance area 30 years ago and now they're only commercial and there's no looking back and so we do an analysis on that in terms of looking to see how far is neighborhood school then we looked at equity and social economics and I'll go a little bit into what we considered equity which is basically and the social economics and then the last thing was academic outcomes and proficiency

[00:07:00]
and the reason we did these variables the way we did them we it was as we did the analysis it was very clear that we have to balance between just looking at the operation of school financially and looking at the cost benefit analysis and balancing that with equity and social economics of the schools because as you know academic outcomes and Proficiency in many cases are related to where the school is at and what the Baseline of that Community is so if we go back to page two you will see a flow chart and what we did is we started with a baseline of all 88 elementary schools 27 middle

[00:08:00]
and the 2K through 8 major schools and what we did is in the first year we did what is called a filtering now we filtered out we looked at capital investment basically if a school had received over 10 million dollars in capital investment by the taxpayer over the last 20 years it was filled it out if the school had been strategically determined as a special educational and it was developed as a special educational and then schools with the high utilization rate which

[00:09:00]
70% or more occupation over a period of 5 years those schools are filtered out which means based on those three variables schools were taken off the table you know if they were very highly utilized in the 70% for if they were special and heavy and if they had had and so when we did that first round of filtering out it resulted in elementary schools for middle schools out of the 88 Elementary School 27 middle schools and 2K 3862 elementary schools so we went to the theater of these 22 elementary schools in

[00:10:00]
we assigned a school based on a rubric so basically the way this work is that the higher the score the more probable the school is as a candidate for right sizing and so the first score was based on utilization utilization rate and so if you go back to page 3 you will see and this will be in in yellow and green that the ones that so we don't need the school is which means if the empty of the schools were giving a

[00:11:00]
play Ohio school so if you are emptier you are more of a candidate for utilize for repurposing then we looked at the percentage of classrooms and Portables if the school had a higher percentage of classrooms and Portables it was given the highest score so it was more a candidate for repurposing and the rationale for that is either you spend millions of dollars replacing those Portables or you Republican was electrical cost per square foot and this is basically the operational cost of running a specific school so the higher cost per square foot means that the building is not efficient which means the building is a lot older which means it needs a lot more

[00:12:00]
which means it's a higher candidate for repurposing the next score was a facility score which is the 5 year master plan architectural evaluation so if the school so the way that works if you remember from the master plan a presentation the closer to 100% the better the facility is so most of us schools are between 80 and 90 so if the school had a lowest score it means it was a better candidate for right side then we went to operational so basically we looked at the operational budget of the school and how many students there

[00:13:00]
and basically if the school had a higher operational cost to rent which means it did not have many students so it was one of the candidates higher candidates for right size now all those technical perspectives were balanced out with some balances where we actually took points away so if even if a school had less kids but it had a high special education percentage it means that we took out some points to balance it out in terms of being suitable for if the school had higher percentages of English language learners

[00:14:00]
so this is an equity kind of balancing so we took some points away to make it balance out from a purely Financial consideration and also if the school was titled one to the title 1 school which is also an equity piece with two points away to balance it out and lastly if the 300 reduced lunch percentage was high in the school cuz we have 100% so don't take enough to balance the purely Technical and financial consideration now if the transfer rate of the school was high which means a transfer Android which means that school is a school whatever reason is a high school

[00:15:00]
we also gave it a law school which means it's less of a candidate for the right size because for some reason people are working with their feet for that school but if the transfer rate out rate is higher means that this is a less sort of school or whatever reason it's more of a candidate for right sizing the zoning ratio of the attendance area commercial to residential if a school over the last 20 years and working in conjunction with the city and the county it seems like the neighborhood is trending from residential to commercial to heavy commercial it means that some neighborhoods that were previously residential and now commercial because of the infrastructure the city and the county

[00:16:00]
those become more candidates for right sizing and then we looked at test scores and proficiency and then this the lower the proficiency the higher the school and basically what we did in the test scores we looked at science English language arts math scores from 2020 by the social networks so basically in a nutshell if you look at page 3 that's how we did the the

[00:17:00]
from highest score to last score and so you see the Tier 1 schools and then you can see the theater schools so when we ran the Tijuana schools with the scoring we came up with five elementary schools and three middle schools and they are listed there on page 5 and those other schools we shall be bringing the recommendation on proposals to right size them based on the analysis stop talking about

[00:18:00]
Olive Garden's elementary students to Reginald Chavez and cochiti Elementary School it also would result in additional classroom space at Reginald Chavez and cochiti elementary school as part of the move for the students and it would redesign and upgrade Duran's into an Early Childhood Center which is part of a prototype we have to add more Early Childhood centers to the districts the second recommendation we have is elementary school for La Luz Elementary School the recommendation we have is to redistrict all of the current location Elementary School attendance area students to MacArthur Elementary School

[00:19:00]
MacArthur would then need an addition of classroom space for their cafeteria Administration and then music and arts and general education classrooms for the la Luz students this would also be the recommendation to add the second Early Childhood Center based on the Prototype design we have for Early Childhood centers across the district the third recommendation and I preface all of these with at the the next part of the presentation will go through a timeline for all of these because each one of these situations are unique in the rollout of what it would need to move forward on so the next one is Kirtland Elementary School this would also be a repurpose for An Early Childhood Center however this particular recommendation is contingent on a land swap with the US Air Force Base who have approached us for swapping the land across

[00:20:00]
where the Maxwell housing used to be for the land of Kirtland so it's across Gibson basically is where they want to swap the land so it would be building the Early Childhood Center on the land swap with the Air Force Base and then they are for space would then have where the current current elementary school is so because it's a land Swap this would be in a complete rebuild of new construction for An Early Childhood Center that would be north of Gibson Boulevard the fourth recommendation is Polk Middle School Polk Middle School are recommendation is to rebuild Los Padilla's elementary school as a small K-8 school that would accommodate both Middle School we also would like to consider the creation of an Outdoor Learning Center facility in conjunction with the Sandia Mountain Natural History Center that we have currently with revived

[00:21:00]
Wetlands at Los Padilla's Elementary School for Polk Middle School we recommend using it as a new future site for expansion on the southwest side of town and a multiple a multi-use outdoor school and possibly adding an early childhood site to the new future sight have to Middle School repurpose just for background information Garfield Middle School Taft Middle School in Taylor Middle School are in the North Valley all within 5 Mi Corridor containing three of the middle schools that you'll see on the recommendation so the purpose the repurpose of Taft Middle School includes to create a bilingual magnet for middle school for Coronado Elementary School so it's really expanding Coronado to have a middle school available for them we've been looking at the data and Mr Garcia is here

[00:22:00]
Department we have found that more than 50% of our fifth graders from Coronado have left the district for middle school and so we're hoping that as you heard at the beginning there's also recommendations here on how to retain some students so that the recommendation in order to retain the students the families at Coronado have desperately asked for a Middle School feeder for the school so this would be expanding Coronado's educational model at Taft this would also mean redistricting Taft Middle School to Taylor and to Garfield Taylor just for your information has already been approved by the latest Bond so we could rebuild the school to scale with the new attendance area based on the construction money that has already been approved for that project we also recommend Garfield to be since it is a STEM Magnet School we recommend to make Garfield a

[00:23:00]
boundary magnet school so the school would be open across the city and it wouldn't have boundaries by attendance sales you'll see Elementary Alameda elementary school is on the list but we recommend that we leave the school as is because in 2008 we were building the school's new gym and we learned that it is built on a Native American archaeological burial sites so any improvements to Alameda Elementary School that entails digging or ground disturbance is problematic and in a lot of cases impossible so we can Alameda Elementary School off the list for repurpose as part of our right size and we try to look at it holistically across the entire district for what is needed and what the community is asking for so some of the other right sizing

[00:24:00]
directions that we are looking at for consideration is scaling out early childhood centers the next we have a sketch of Early Childhood centers to be throughout the city so the next four Early Childhood centers would be for land that we have the 4 Northeast adjacent to Desert Ridge the far north west which is next to Coyote Willow then your Heights which is near the Stephen Moody special education complex and then the South Valley that we spoke about either at Polk or Harrison the second option for consideration is similar to Coronado Corrales Elementary School is a small school elementary school of 500 students in the last Bond we did receive money to rebuild the school and we have had a lot of input from that community that they would like it to be a K-8 school so we do recommend

[00:25:00]
Corrales into a K-8 school as we redesign and rebuild it based on the last bond election to be able to move that school into a Pre-K to 8 school that Corrales Elementary School also when we pulled their data has more than 50% of their fifth graders who do leave the district after 5th grade so it's not transferring to another school they're supposed to their zone for Taylor Middle School but they leave the school district so that is another right sizing option to bring students back in the families have expressed their support to that school being a case the third consideration is Janet Kahn School of integrated arts and this is similar to Garfield where we recommend to remove the attendance boundary of Janet Kahn and make it a pure Magnet School of Choice and

[00:26:00]
redistrict the students who are currently zoned for Janet Cod we do propose for our schools of choice on the magnet schools that we have bus stops five bus stops super stops throughout the district that would be able to bring the students to the school so that's one of our proposals that we bring with Janet Kahn is that we would have a similar process that we do with the charter schools where we would have five stops throughout the city that can pick the students up so for Janet conspecific if there is a group of students in the neighborhood who want to stay at that school we would have a super stop at that bus location to the next is boundary changes that are needed to balance out enrollment and we did look at feeder patterns in these recommendations as we go through the analysis most of these are on the far north west

[00:27:00]
View Elementary School Tony hillerman and James Monroe Volcano Vista in Cibola and then in the southwest we need to balance out Navajo Barcelona Rudolfo Anaya and Adobe acres and those would be boundary shifts for those schools to balance out the enrollment and looking at our right sizing options we still do see that we have a deficit of a high school special education Hub on the west side that we need to look at for either high school and we also are looking at Mountain View Los Padilla's pool in Rio Grande for the magnet school agricultural expansion and we can move if we do with that so you might have heard Mr Garcia present the information on the grant for cultivating the future and so we can still move forward with that Grant looking at school that would feed him

[00:28:00]
and that particular cramps so as I said we have a timeline for each of these projects that were proposing and Mr with NJ will walk through just a couple of the timelines and then you'll be able to see the rest on the packet that you have thank you so much the first thing you will see is that for every action propose is an almost equal opposite reaction so for example if you make this into an Early Childhood Center it's not just a matter of taking the kids and putting the original Chavez and coaching will have to be in

[00:29:00]
cast in capacity to be able to take that extra hundred and fifty or so kids and so right now we do have some funding some of it came from the Essa covid funds of which they will be bringing to you I think on Wednesday to approve for the design of cochiti as An Early Childhood Center and also for design of a 5 class block and a bigger Cafe 2023 which is the first phase and will be designed of those

[00:30:00]
rebounder of of Duran's students will also be done in 2023 proposed and to take in effect in 2025 because then the classroom the extra space has to be redesigned and completed so 2024 the center and the construction of classrooms which is still on funded it's only found it for the design so 2024 Remodel and of the center and construction of the classroom and 2025 full roll out the kids will actually leave and go to the new spaces and the Early Childhood Center will open so I just wanted to go through one of those because that's something that's already kind of being picked off the second thing I want to go through will be on

[00:31:00]
page 9 which will be converting which will be other right sizing proposal which will be converting Corrales Elementary School into a small 600 student Pre-K to school so there's the taxpayers have already passed the funding for redesigning and partially rebuilding Corrales and that will be brought before the board separately because it's a separate issue for you to approve the design additions for the pre-k through 8 school but what we can do is that the current fifth graders can be the first sixth grade cohort that will go to Colorado school that is space for them currently in Corrales to do that but meanwhile we have to make

[00:32:00]
do that the additions are designed this year after you approve them start construction and finishing 2024 and by the time they get to 7th grade they will have something that is key for Middle School which is science labs and music and art and So the plan is construct finished constructing additions in 2025 and by 2026 Karen 5th graders will now be in 8th grade so they will just continue on in Corrales so that's the second one the last example this is something we can do right away is the enrollment balancing of student attendance areas you know you on the North West that's the theater on Tigo

[00:33:00]
review Tony hillerman James Monroe Volcano Vista and sabola and then on the Southwest the balancing of Navajo Barcelona radar for Anaya and Adobe Acres that can be done this year and taking and going to affect in 2024 last thing designating Janet Khan as a former net and it'll start in effect 2024 because again the 5th graders who will make it a magnet with construction finishing up Janet Khan we should be done by this phone so by next year Janet can be ready to be a full moon so I'll give it back to Dr Blakey clarification

[00:34:00]
but we can go through each individually on the time I'm bringing those first particularly looking at those boundaries shifts of the far north west for Southwest and the Garfield and Janet Kahn would be kind of the first step and then going through each of those recommendations individually and further meetings but we would like to get feedback on the committee's recommendations as well as any questions you have and again we do have staff part

[00:35:00]
play from the academic side and the school-based side to answer any questions that you have thank you it's a lot to absorb for sure so I know that there's a lot of discussion and work that has gone into this and board members I think there are two things that are on the table for us one is is just going through and and asking questions that we might have right now but it's also the recommendation that we have a work group that's assigned you know some board members that are assigned to work with this team around this so that we can continue to bring recommendations to the to the regular board as we're going through and then finalizing this so I think what I like to do first is to go through I think for some of the questions that we have to space on the presentation that was brought before us so that we can go through those first and then what will do is

[00:36:00]
and I'm thinking the work group on this will be pretty specific because it's not it's not cutting across the entire District I think there is definitely areas that are not as highly impacted and so I think board members that would be part of that would be you know would be pretty strategic in terms of who we would assign to to help us to help the District staff as they're working through this and making sure that we've got more representation on there and with the conversations that we might have so why don't we start first with just some of the questions that board members might have around the presentation tonight let's try to be succinct because we're not going to have them all answered tonight obviously I mean I think there's there's a lot of gaps because my my my brain had there's still a lot of gaps but maybe we could just go through just some series of quick questions knowing that we don't have all the answers

[00:37:00]
but maybe some real high-level conversation around things that would help this committee as they're going forward so why don't I start with board member Jackson okay so I think the the first thing that really popped out at me was that I don't see any recommendations in here to either repurpose these for Charter Schools or to close or sell the property and I was just wondering why board member Jackson the property to the Charter Schools or to close the buildings and sell them so I'm looking up the repurposing recommendations we saw

[00:38:00]
play in each of those a need for what we propose I need for expansion into areas that we don't currently have the ability to do primarily looking at the Early Childhood hubs so the first recommendations that are repurposing into Early Childhood hubs is because we've seen a big increase in the need for Early Childhood expansion and at this point we don't have the facilities behind our ability to serve the community for early childhood and the facilities for Early Childhood are very specific to what is needed so we'd have to repurpose them into that so that's why our recommendation primarily at looking at the Early Childhood is to renovate the those properties particularly looking at Uranus Elementary School for example there is already a charter school that shares basically the fence with and so it doesn't that

[00:39:00]
property itself lends to be a great candidate for the need to fill in early childhood I will I'm assuming that board member Tapia Romero has more questions about Early Childhood so you don't necessarily need to answer this and because she'll probably bring it up but I I just wonder that if these are elementary schools that we can't fill with elementary school children How likely it's going to be that we can fill them with Pre-K but I'm just going to leave that and I'll let her so board member Jackson members of the board one of the things in analysis that we've done since early childhood given the Constitution is mandatory childhood in the

[00:40:00]
and in the Albuquerque Public Schools district alone there are 14,000,003 and 4 year olds that are going to be covered by this of which at this time about 2800 are being served by both private Early Childhood providers APS CYFD and the city and the county the bulk is being done by APS that is 2000 and then the rest are being done by the city county state but they are also being done at 8:00 facility's so if you think about scaling up to

[00:41:00]
14,000 students it would not make any sense to give up facilities today and then go back to the taxpayer in the next 5 years and ask them to build up to 15 facilities to serve an extra $14,000 students that is one of the issues and then the other issue is that in studying there's a cost to shuttering on the utilize facilities and selling on the utilize for sale the kind of resources that can then be brought back to support instruction on a recurring basis that money has been to go back to the same courts which is either facilities or

[00:42:00]
and so it's just that that's the financial part of it in terms of a cost-benefit analysis and Justin response to specifically Early Childhood this plan which I suggest at a further meeting be really looked at just as far as Early Childhood expansion on its own as a further to topic but this plan involves us being able to have these spaces for multi-use so we would be able to partner with other agencies that would want to utilize some of the space because space that is being able to be occupied for Early Childhood his is very specific so if we have the ability to convert some of our schools are expansion to be able to partner with other entities who would then be able to utilize the space grows a few years ago we started as a few years ago is probably

[00:43:00]
Pre-K being part of an elementary school and it's been interesting to see it evolve that although at the beginning it was part of elementary school there's been more and more of a need primarily from parents to really want to focus their children in An Early Childhood Center rather than going to an elementary school and so what started as kind of pre-K at each elementary school has turned into more of a hub of pre-K students and that I think is based on some parents wishes you know that they would like to have their three and four year olds that their own site as well as being able to utilize resources effectively particularly with our developmental preschool that we can have staff at a site that's able to respond to students without having to have one at 89 different elementary schools okay thank you I think I have two more

[00:44:00]
so I also did find it interesting looking at the feedback that came from the community is to what they were looking for overwhelmingly I heard that there was a need for CTE and again there was no recommendation to utilize any of these facilities for that specifically so I don't know if there's a specific the Board of Education and the administration on Friday you will be seeing the opening of the New York and for those like I think

[00:45:00]
play board member Peterson and board member Dominguez you will see a 15 to 20% of that site was specifically acquired with a mind to put in stand-up CTE Hub which will not only serve the education of students but will be able to hopefully do things like develop heavy diesel mechanics bus drivers and work with a business Community to and the unions to come up with an apprenticeship program and so that's in the works it's not in this right size specifically because it's on another thing but again like Dr Blakey said as we go and approach these you can

[00:46:00]
see this is very comprehensive it's very wide as we go and approach these specifically one by one those issues will be brought up and a CTE strategy is going to be brought up by the administration and instructions and as part of the Early Childhood expansion proposal we do for see partnering with CNM particularly to look at growing Early Childhood Educators as part of a learning Lab at these Early Childhood sites let's see I think I guess probably the most the other question I have is if we're having to do we this might be preliminary but do we have a cost benefit analysis

[00:47:00]
that's because I'm seeing a lot of needing to rebuild and needing to expand but I don't see how where is the the cost savings coming I see the the output but where is where is the benefit where is the savings so they'll be costs when we going to them individually you'll see the technical call saving analysis from the capital side but there's also a specific call saving analysis and Consolidated Schools you know what you're talking about stuff principles nurses p e t t electric bills because what we are proposing over here is not only Consolidated Schools that are too small so that you can put them in one spot but then bringing a new population

[00:48:00]
that will recurring Leon the schools that the spaces that have been vacated so this is a very expansionist kind of proposal in terms of where consolidating what is too small right now and proposing to bring in new students and new fde to run what has been vacated so so this is our 10,000 feet View and you're saying that it what's coming is the specifics as how much does this is going to cost and how much we're going to save for each specific for each School Board member we can break it down by each school like they said as we get to it as we said how long this is not a great way to save money in the sense that if you have a 1005 teachers when you move the 1005 teachers go with them because you got to still have the same teachers for the kids but it does though for the receiving School

[00:49:00]
does want to get some renovation so it's a little bit spiffed up and two it hopefully allows them to begin to add programs that maybe they wouldn't be able to have in a very small school you really limited when you have a staff of five you know you're just really are our stuff but now you've got kids having access to a full-time librarian full-time nursing Services full-time Community coordinator there's a lot of ancillary staff that come along with that that benefits I think the students on that regard so and it allows us to sort of consolidate though so if I have maybe two halftime at two schools and when they become one full-time and then another one becomes a full-time somewhere else it's just it's better and it creates a more comprehensive setting for the students

[00:50:00]
early on cost-benefit analysis and then it became strictly a cost analysis and then superintendent Elder ended with the benefit analysis I think it's going to be for me very important that you highlight in that cost analysis a definite benefit analysis because I think that's part of it in the long-term there is a benefit I have and I don't know if I have a question about this or just I want to know a concern but it's gotten lost a notes I just want to be certain that we avoid displacing local neighborhood children when Janet Khan

[00:51:00]
what's an open boundary school that we make every effort to avoid a waiting list for local kids and that we are encouraging local neighborhood kids to be included and I think Mr Garcia is ready here part of the neighborhood so really providing the opportunity for those students who live in reside in that Community entrance into the school and then doing a facility utilization study to find out what the total number of students in that school can occupy

[00:52:00]
we allow all of the students who reside in the community we would take the number of requests that are from outside of the community and we would do a lottery for those students who are outside of the community hitting the total number of interested students and the number of available seats but we're looking at probably years down the road until we reach that full facility civilization so with Dr Blakey also explained is that we're going to try to create super stops for students that reside in the community but also outside of the community so we can ensure access for those students in the schools and so conversely and I just lost that thought it had to do with who else did we talk about

[00:53:00]
with so much movement right I think there's an opportunity to mailed Transportation limitations particularly with regard to charter schools in the Northwest Valley with all this movement I know we've had one charter school that could afford to increase its Hispanic population and I think this right size of you know I don't know what the relationship is how how that goes how the conversations go between APS and Charter Schools but to get demographics to reflect more than the neighborhoods

[00:54:00]
so really magnet schools are offering theme-based instruction that attract students like a magnet I really want to find out about Megan schools diverse by recruiting and retaining students from well across the city we're in a very competitive landscape right now in education families really many families really like having a portfolio of choice options that we chose to be you know not many students leave the district after 5th grade and what are we going to do as a district different to retain our own students and also provide an expensive portfolio choices for these families I think this might bring us back into a Competitive Edge

[00:55:00]
whisper parochial schools but also charter schools in the district and we want we want to be competitive like Charter Schools like also parochial and other schools I'm really providing that landscape of choice and and rigorous programs and I just remembered what eluded me earlier so we were talking about creating an extension bilingual magnet school extension to Coronado and so that's Taft Middle School how will we ensure that the neighborhood schools that feed into town get some opportunity to be part of the Taft bilingual magnet

[00:56:00]
depending on where they're at as far as Bible education it would be a 50/50 model so meaning that students would have instruction on 50% in Spanish this is emerging as I'm asking these questions is which elementary schools feeding into it I don't know that right off the top of my head how

[00:57:00]
I believe and I'm listening to Los Ranchos and Alameda feeds to test and some of Alvarado Los Angeles the reality of that is that we're seeing a lot of those schools opted out instead of going to Taft museum schools potentially as

[00:58:00]
the general population gives us an opportunity to be more competitive with the local charter school that's down there quite frankly taking quite a few of our kids this will also allow the continuation of the curriculum at Coronado which you all pointed out is one of our best and most desirable magnet schools and those parents drive their kids are from all over we actually sharted them so they're from all over their kids to the school to receive the services they want and I guess my question is how do we create a system like a situation whereby the kids from Los Angeles how do we get them to to be able to tap into this great Taft

[00:59:00]
because we want to set them up to be able to participate period Alvarado has a barely robust bilingual program it is not the same it's not a dual language program like at Coronado but they do run a program Alameda this year lost their Heritage speaker allocation that person left after the school year so we've had to adjust the model but the the students are there and there is the desire we would need to increase a little bit of that focus and additionally the those students would be zoned then to go to Taylor so they would have they would be going to Taylor Taylor about a mile away from each other so the students that would choose to have a more

[01:00:00]
additional Middle School experience would go to Taylor based on their location and is Taylor looking at a focus of some you know something to attract the comprehensive Middle School experience traditional Middle School experience for those students who should choose their non-magnet or non-poc school they also serve as a special education Hub okay let's see how can we do what we can always come back to you excited to hear about Early Childhood so one of my big concerns and I believe you all should be familiar with it is the Pre-K actor that's in statute says that we have to have a 50/50 split between public Pre-K and community

[01:01:00]
going forward into this it looks like we would be potentially violate with the Pre-K act what's in statute because we would no longer share equal numbers based on what's happening in community-based programs has that been looked at I don't know from the programmatic side of Early Childhood that's why I'm looking at they know from the program it has been discussed I would say about a year ago we came into the conversation about this time we discovered that there was a lot that asked us to go out and talk to the private providers and let them know what we were doing I think this will be pretty gradual I don't think you're not in the intentional it won't be a massive movement it could eventually my feeling is the market will probably play some role in

[01:02:00]
how we ultimately end up and how many of these we end up with but at the moment we do know there's a large percentage of students who are not being served by the groups and I don't think it's a lack of willingness on either and it's a lack of facilities and people and we are with the hubs it gives us an opportunity to pull people together so instead of having small programs at 50 schools we can have robust programs at a number of schools across the city so I think the numbers in some ways will balance out a little bit and see if you can do some of the numbers we have currently but yes we are looking at bringing in more students and that's sort of our job is Administration is to look at how can we increase student enrollment so we would have to work with the private providers as far as opening steps to solve the number of problems well and you kind of lend me

[01:03:00]
play next question because you said there should be conversations taking place with the community-based providers which in my experience those conversations have not taken place because many of the programs within those areas have openings they have not been filled completely and to know again that we're going to put new hubs in these places yet current programs that are already open still have openings and again it didn't really answer my question regarding the Pre-K act that's in statues so legally we have to abide by 50% in public 50% in private and when you say they can't keep up essentially a space is aren't being filled currently they're not going to be able to expand at the rate of what you're talking about on both ends and us still be able to meet the requirement of the law a golden would be to like I said I don't need to provide services for kids that's really our enrolled

[01:04:00]
we can follow the law and we can certainly look at the legislature and see if there needs to be any sort of modifications to help advance that the plan simply takes into account that we have a need to I think to service children better idea of hubs seems to make sense because again it provides the ability to group people with talents and skills as well as have all the stuff in one place so there's that if the law forces us to have more Community meetings which I think we're more than happy to do I do know that I think part of the problem is we don't have anyone currently in the world is that correct we see we're still looking for someone so we've got different levels of people managing the program at the moment so that's sort of what our stars in effect but this is the capital of it and I appreciate you bringing up that will have to maintain an eye on that act as well

[01:05:00]
so we have to become more familiar with with those steps as we move forward and then I guess as you're talking it's adding additional questions I don't even on my list here because when you say that we don't even have somebody in place now to manage that particular Department yet we're looking at building it out extensively and knowing that we're adding additional three and four year olds to our our schools and within an Early Childhood Program yet these districts that were in now are not meeting proficiency they are low attendance programs and we're going to draw an additional age group more not even currently meeting the need of the age that's there now so it concerns me especially as we draw

[01:06:00]
lower to really focus on student outcomes that why aren't we making sure that the group that we are already charged with our responsibility to make sure that they're proficient yet now we're going to add even younger children to the mix when we're not even doing what we're supposed to do now so I don't know what is our plan to ensure that the three and four year olds are having proper student outcomes if our K through five students at those schools currently do not well what we know and again I don't have it in front of me but what we do know board members that the students have gone through comprehensive programs traditionally do better and that could be private or public we obviously we know that providing those services in early age investing in early childhood investing in literature and and this will help us especially in areas that we're seeing struggles and hopefully

[01:07:00]
would think that if you were a family member and you lived there and it was easier to get your Pre-K student there you might be more likely to come so yes I'm looking at student outcomes and exactly what is that school producing and how proficient are the students currently I look back when I had a young children my daughter did not go to the school even though it was right there in our district based on the outcomes of the school so I was willing to drive across town to ensure she had the education she I feel that she deserved granted I know we were making steps but I don't think that's always a deciding factor when families are making that decision for their students so I just disagree with that when we look at you know again I want to touch back on have we looked at the availability and the openings for Early Childhood in those

[01:08:00]
14,003 year olds but I'm talking specifically in that District alone and what is the unmet need a board member Tapia Romero yes we have we have done in-depth analysis to look at how many 4 year olds that are in all these districts and in fact what we found is that the most 4 year olds are in districts that are not served by either public or private providers and this is because the current Paradigm of Early Childhood in New Mexico before the Constitutional amendment was mostly basing Early Childhood service on social networks and so miss Courtney Jackson's District

[01:09:00]
District by far have the most thousands of of of of of of potential students and the reason we are doing this is right now they're not served by anybody now I ate myself I go back to 2004 2005 when you remember it used to be half the kindergarten just like and it was based on social economic kind of Matrix and title one and all that and then the legislature came in just like this time although this time is a constitutional amendment but they came in and they made it hold a kindergarten and what happened is still being felt right now when they said all they kindergarten they realized that they don't have the facilities and the teachers for what they have

[01:10:00]
what used to be half day kindergarten was served by half the teachers and it was in only in areas that were eligible what happened is that they made it to Universal and all of a sudden most kindergartens were in the Northeast Heights and the far west side and in the Middle Valley and what the what the legislature did at the time is to scramble and get at that time we had oil and gas money to just like now and they got Portables kindergarten Portables Statewide and try to install them they hadn't finished installing all day kindergarten Portables by 2014 and so with this we realized Early Childhood is not kindergarten it's not elementary school so it will be a lot more

[01:11:00]
Beyonce and we want to be ready we've been working on this for about 6 years and in fact some of our prototype designs with shared with school districts across the state and some of them are already doing what we're proposing to do a Santa Fe Rio Rancho Roswell and they were doing it in anticipation to the day when they'll be mandated Early Childhood across state what I what I tell a lot of like we've had the same conversation with the city and the county because of it they said if you guys are going to do Hobbs what happens to our site and when I show them the numbers and and tell them there is not enough of all of us to serve what is coming it's a tsunami of kids and we will have

[01:12:00]
to work together with none with non-public Public public providers are institutions in terms of what these herbs will do so that we can know who will be doing the child care part will be doing the education part will be doing the security part will be doing the facility part and it will take the resources of all of us to get this done cuz there's a lot of kids you know where we're going to jump from 2000 kids to 14000 kids and this will be done in phases probably over the next 6 to 10 years and right now if you are the new department they don't know how this is this will roll out and I think communities that are ready and have a plan that's possibly what the legislature will go with my final question

[01:13:00]
but I want to make sense of this cuz I feel like I'm receiving contradictory information cuz tonight you're saying we're going to have a tsunami of enrollment and we're not going to be so many kids that need to be served yet in previous conversations about this past year we talked about declining Birthright why kindergarten enrollment is at an all-time low yet we suddenly feel like it's going to be filled with Pre-K with Early Childhood hubs so where did these children suddenly come from the 14000 we're talking about already there they just not sure most of them stare at home some of them come to provide his base on the current Paradigm you got to qualify to get into Early Childhood right now and so not completely but again I want to I want to just clarify we said this for the since I've been on the board for the past year that enrollment is low a

[01:14:00]
kindergarten was so low but now we are assuming that it's going to have the Skyrocket jump tsunami of attendance is what you said and I don't know how now where did this the shift come from Captain America sometimes you have to translate a little bit we are prepared to serve those kids were prepared to serve children when they come to us in kindergarten we have the infrastructure we have the teachers we have so those kids are coming we're not prepared at the Early Childhood so he talks about this is where it's going to be only at that impact the other thing we think and you know this is a belief is that by bringing those kids in early that they'll become more committed to APS and more committed to the school so they're attached you know if you get attached to a school you start to meet people build relationships that don't have kids leave us prior to coming in his kindergarten schools they go to private schools

[01:15:00]
Catholic schools you know whatever it is this will give us an opportunity to to touch your hands with the community in a very different way so that's where the tsunami is it's at the at the Pre-K level it's not necessarily going to be inundated every other grade level up okay so I'm going to kind of Romero was saying so right now I'm in 2022 20/506 kindergarteners we have 1,828 preschoolers so I I too just can't see the numbers that you're predicting I don't see them there so then the other question to go along with that is

[01:16:00]
we have I know we don't have that many places for preschoolers like I understand that and perhaps that's why we just have the $1,828 Pre-K students so I'm sure that somebody knows this how many Pre-K students are on a waiting list for APS Pre-K programs so let me take a the first question the question that board member Topia Romero and you are asking is with preschool what we're talking about is 3 and 4 year olds so if you combine three and four year olds with approximately 5,000 kindergarteners we have each year then we're only serving a thousand students but we know that there's the combination of three and four year olds out there that are in various places or not anywhere at all so the

[01:17:00]
the combination of number is 2 inches of 3 and 4 year olds and then it's going it's like funneled into just the kindergarten number so I think that's where the numbers coming from but at a the next meeting or study session that you have we can go over the complete Early Childhood proposal along with making we're presenting from the capital side and a lot of the questions regarding like the programming side which of course is really important to the plan I think would be more of an in-depth study with bringing Dr segura's team in on as far as the question regarding the sites that are full we have some sites that have way it's dependent on the site so we do have several sites that do have waiting lists and then we have some sites that do not right and so I know this as well and also kind of speaking to what has already been my fellow board members have already said

[01:18:00]
is many of those and I know this from parents wanting their children to be in in a preschool and APS preschool but a lot of the openings are in schools where the children at the schools are not doing as well academically or on tests and you already know what I think about test but they're so those are and I don't know if it's true and that's something that you can let us know are those schools don't seem to have their precious as filled as other schools where the children may be doing better academically so that's something else that you can bring to us as well and it are speaks to what has already been said about that as well how are we going to draw kids into some of these hubs when we're not drying the kids because those schools may not be doing with some parents you know feel is the right thing for their children so that's something you can you know present to us then as well and I know

[01:19:00]
what are the things that I have questions over things that we will do and I'm sure in the work study group to but when it comes to I too like member Jackson don't understand and after speaking to a whole lot of commercial Realtors who think that it would be some of the places that we have are some of these schools are places where there is nowhere for them for the neighborhood to grow now on the West Side there's a place for it to grow but some of these don't so I see that if we sold some of those schools that it would bring the possibility of building new neighborhoods and areas where there isn't space for new neighborhoods and we all know how housing is really lacking in our city and so that's just something I would like you all to just keep in mind that maybe that would be something good for some of these neighborhoods and we'd obviously have to study

[01:20:00]
you know which neighborhood might that be helpful to I know some developers would would love to be able to build neighborhoods and I'm sure that you have seen you can see that across the country and some of the infield that has happened like you can look at Detroit and you can look at some of those places where they did build you know these neighborhoods to try to drop people in so that's just a thought when I'm looking and this is something I know you already said you're going to talk about and I'm just going to kind of go through some that way you all have it I know these are questions you don't you know necessarily have answers to I would like to know what is the cost to you know shuttering a school how you find that it's not possible to make money on selling our schools and also you already spoke to that cost savings and cost analysis that you'll present to us all so in repurposing

[01:21:00]
I know when I started on the board almost 8 years ago we had like 86,000 and some students and then when I'm looking at supper now we have 71,119 students that's like $15,000 less students in less than 8 years and that is that's big I just don't know where we are going to get these students to fill some of these these hubs when I know that there are so many Romero said there's so many openings and so many education you know early childhood centers across the entire District so I want to know how much square footage so some of these schools are going to have to be knocked down and rebuilt to serve the purpose that you all outlined so I would like to know how much square footage we're going to lose or possibly

[01:22:00]
maybe how much square footage we might gain I would assume that everything is going to be built smaller than the schools are currently that's just my assumption but I don't know that that's the case I know that we're going to need staff at these redesigned you know buildings so are we going to with less students are we going to GameStop is it going to basically stay the same because it's not I just don't see us coming up with thousands of more Early Childhood children and then the other question that you can let us know about is in each of these redesigned bills tell us an idea of what the enrollment you think is going to be so how different is it going to be I mean around his house I think 130 I'd have to look it up I just I went through that

[01:23:00]
this afternoon 131 students so is the redesign there going to have more than $131 students and what's the square footage in the cost in the benefit Etc I want also to know what the cost up front for the redesign for for each of these that you've presented and what I know you can't tell me exactly but what the cost would be to operate you know these new buildings let's see and then the other question I know you mentioned Alameda that is built on a burial site so is that going to limit everything going forward for what we can do at Alameda when it comes to you know rebuilding tearing things down so we're going to have to leave the school the way it is forever correct or something that you have to be very careful

[01:24:00]
it's a long process before you disturb what you need to disturb you have to work with the University of New Mexico with a state and that's the right thing to do yes you know yeah and so to go and do a total even if we were saying to put this school out for hypothetically to offer disposal whoever will get it will have to go through the same thing right and they should know that if that's what if that's what they choose to do they would know they would have to do that which is I'm sure they would have they would do the right thing as well so then this is just something that I thought about as you were talking about so many if I'm wrong but I just remember I think it was you know when Raquel was superintendent that because he schools have gotten like so it was just

[01:25:00]
like overwhelming they were just so big I thought that the decision was made to not have any more Kate schools is that incorrect so the K-8 schools that were looking at is a smaller scale I know on a smaller scale where the same students that are there from kindergarten would continue through 8th grade I think the decision that was a K-8 where it's 6th grade a new group of kids came in and then you see the growth I think that was where the previous administration was calling a halt to but a small K-8 we have particularly Corrales in Coronado we have families begging for us to create school for those the intent would be for those kindergarteners students to stay all the way through 8th grade at those schools I mean I know that's something that Corrales has You Know spoken about for a while so I know that's something that they want and I

[01:26:00]
I know a lot of the funding will be there but I'm kind of looking at your timeline and I'm saying is that really realistic for all these you know look for all of these redesigns is that truly truly realistic and you can tell me it is and I'll be like yeah that's good or you could tell me maybe it's not I mean that may change I just want to make sure that we're giving information to the public that is realistic because whatever we say they're going to count on us doing what we're saying that we're going to do you see in the timelines contingent on board approval so these are recommendations you will be getting a recommendation I think Wednesday

[01:27:00]
pause we didn't want to bring this to you before we had this discussion now and I have got not a single solitary parents Community member that has said they don't want it they all want it so you know which is good you don't have to wonder what they want so then the other question and you can just refresh my memory and I might have I'm sure it's here I've just been asked this question about boundary changes on the west side because parents are getting very worried and they were worried during the redistricting that it was going to affect School boundary changes and I told him that the redistricting didn't affect School boundaries that's a different process so I want to be clear with them when and if we do these boundary changes for Terra Vista on you and Tony hillerman and James Monroe and volcano

[01:28:00]
when were those like definitely take effect when are those parents going to know I just had one that was going parent that was going to be moving from the civil district wanted to move to the Volcano Vista district and they were moving from Corrales they want to know to make sure that they're going to be in you know the volcano District so just to clarify these boundaries what we call rebalancing is an attempt to make sure that the feeders so that kids as much as possible start at an elementary school to the same school to the same high school what does happen you have kids on the edge who have to go from some of them go to theater and then they end up

[01:29:00]
and then some of them you know so we want and we're talking about a minority of parents we're not going to be changing the The Volcano Vista boundary the big boundary of the people of boundary but we're going to be trying to balance out the feet of school so that parents have more of a regular path so that they're not this as you know and it's your District there's a confusion sometimes those kids because of such a crowding in the past had to come to I think it was sunset view and some of them go to sleep well as some of them Volcano Vista some of them thought they were going to bring some recommendations to the board to look at okay and disruptive responsible okay

[01:30:00]
so when your casito then so when you're trying to tell me then is that you want the kids to stay whatever neighborhood and that they're just going to kind of stay where right with your parents are going to stay with that feedback so then has nothing much to do with the number of students and because obviously we know that you get on the wall has like 800 students or something and the Tony hillerman has way over 1000 kids so it's not going to really necessarily affect the enrollment then when you change that you were right it's almost to the 1000 again and that's an issue for 1,035 that's a new school in the future I mean we can't stop moving them and bringing them back all the way to say

[01:31:00]
Petroglyph and then when we build a new school where they're going to take them out of petroglyph back to Tierra Antigua to the new school this is and this is an issue we haven't done you know covid kind of stopped things a little bit recession stop things a little bit but usually every 3 to 4 years we usually bring a proposal to make sure that the feeder systems are balanced and there's a little disruption as possible okay I just I just want to make sure these parents that you know that they know that as soon as possible that would be very helpful to them and then lastly is I just want to make sure that we're really looking at the economic feasibility of just not selling any of these properties basically and keeping them all is that really the right is that the really the right thing to do and then my last honestly I have

[01:32:00]
a whole bunch more but I'll stop my last question would be I know when Ruben was here and he was looking he put a lot of this together did you all use a lot of what he already had or is this something like you're starting from scratch or did you use a lot of the information he had and I know some things have changed because that was several years ago yes we started with him on this and then Scott came on and then gabriela's now leading it it's actually building on the analysis that will started in 2014 with the number of proposals and then I think he's gone through some modification because the intent of the boards a little bit different each time so but yeah Rick where did that come from that was a joint effort between

[01:33:00]
apartments and we had principles we had the planners because the planners have a lot we included our academic people so we had a little bit of an academic element in there but really at that point it was more of a matter of really beginning to look at enrollment and how are we going to impact enrollment at one time there was a more of a focus on trying to magnetize schools and try to lure students back that is not proven as effective as we hoped and the enrollment is continued to decline so we stepped away from other week give the way we magnetized before it was more of a popcorn model versus engineering the future and the cultivating the future proposal so part of the reason that the magnet schools you see in here in this proposal are there is because we know them to be

[01:34:00]
successful in our community already and it's Community request that they stay so thank you remember Gonzalez thank you I think you answered this a little better but my first question is could someone just please summarize describe and walk me through the timeline for the board rule so we're having this initial presentation tonight we're seeing the rubric for the first time you're saying they'll be both on Duran and Carlos coming up what's the overall time frame and what exactly does the board vote on and have authority over versus the administration so the board has authority over the finance part of the plans as well as the boundary changes to the plans the rest are Administration recommendations but certainly would get your feedback and know what the the wants to needs of your community are before moving forward but so

[01:35:00]
the finance part for example of Durant's is to begin design of An Early Childhood Center so that would go to the board for a vote as far as the design of An Early Childhood Center as well as any of the boundary votes so for example if we were to Unbound jury Janet Kahn we would need the board to vote on the new boundary for the elementary school in that area thank you and I guess this is sort of that's sort of related to my second question is what sort of guardrails might be in place to inform the decisions Etc and so I asked because they best practices to give preferential treatment to students who are in a closing school to select the next school so essentially operating like an open enrollment system solely for those kids so if a vacancy exists anywhere

[01:36:00]
first opportunity to claim it so have you thought about that as well versus just putting them in the nearest geographically school at this point we had thought about putting them in the nearest Geographic school but if the plan is moving forward that they would have option to move sooner than if they were to wait for the school to close so for example if the students at Joanna's wanted to go to Reginald Chavez and we knew that the school was going to be repurposed we would be able to move them we haven't had discussions about that but it's certainly wouldn't be off the table as far as the preference I believe it would come to the board in that sense because there is a policy about transfers for students so we would have to look at the transfer policy to add the preference of a transfer for students who school was repurposed or closed right okay I think that's definitely worth considering so certainly should a student Duran

[01:37:00]
Community engagement whom have you spoken to who has been engaged within the community who has been a process who has been a part of this process so far and what thoughts and recommendations do you have on how we engage the community from here forward so what number Gonzalez members of the board when we initially did the analysis in 2017 20/18 we commissioned survey called the voice of the community service to ask Community what works what doesn't work what they like to see and we did this by ZIP code by by school types

[01:38:00]
and what we intend to do moving forward Dr Segura and Mr Garcia intending to commission another voice of the community survey or something of that sort as to it's been 3 years later the things that were talked about in that survey still pregnant are there any more new issues that are going to be going to come up and I think the survey something that we're going to make available to the board again it's very interesting in terms of different parts of the city want different things with a c t e whether a little bit differently if I could just clarify specifically about these schools and these

[01:39:00]
School Board considers proposal to close duranes Elementary Kirtland Elementary Etc will that be the first time that those School communities are hearing that so the school communities yes so the next phase is for us to build a school Community that's the next phase in the process is to build a school committee that then would look at the process of repurposing that school so for this particular meeting this is the first the principal's are aware of it the community is going to be aware of it tomorrow and then the schools that are early on the timeline would be the ones that would start with that school committee to talk about it so in that school committee meeting they could say Juliana's we're really interested in going to this school or we're really interested to see if whether the possibilities and that's at the point where we would talk to the families about what their interest is in the next School in repurposing that school

[01:40:00]
that's what I was asking about time frame is there are there any other components of the process related to community engagement that you haven't spoken to already besides these School communities just the committee and then we have you I mean luckily this past semester we have received a lot of opportunities to listen to the community and what they're looking for so it has been hard to run this our committee at the same time at the to make sure that we're still adapting to the previous so that's why this is a you know it's a draft this is the first time it's in front of you to get your input on questions that you have concerns you have is this matching the needs that you're hearing from your communities is it completely off base are there different needs and the only thing that I would say wouldn't change is the schools that were identified because that was done with a very method

[01:41:00]
call technical evaluation so those schools are really kind of the tight of what we're looking at but the timeline and what will repurpose with each school is still fluid as we go through each School individually and further meetings and then so cancel that for you and sort of respond a little bit to some of the other conversation around Early Childhood hubs what I hear a lot from my community about is a desire to have the Early Childhood spaces in the elementary schools so the kids can go for their three year old year for old year 5 year old kindergarten first Etc so worth considering the value of adding on Early Childhood space and K5 settings versus otherwise but to be considered my other question is I'm curious about the broader middle school strategy and how that fits into this so superintendent Elder you've spoken about a middle school task force and as we're talking about bringing families back into the district it's

[01:42:00]
points in the pipeline is Middle School so with so many kids leaking out right there it doesn't seem to me that that just turning Taft into a bilingual magnet will be the solution that we need for middle school so it'd be great to hear about the broader middle school strategy and how that connects to this good evening everyone board member Gonzalez and members of the board I have had the honor of being a part of the Middle School redesign team and we just wrapped up our last last week and have some recommendations to be able to bring to you all we are first taking them to cabinet for discussion and consideration But ultimately it's looking at when we look at and rolling drops we know we looked back way like in 1314 up until now it's very clear that there is a drop from

[01:43:00]
fifth grade to sixth grade and then it jumps way up to 9th grade and then it trickles down to 12 and so with that we prioritize you know what are the let's just reach for the stars and see what do we feel putting our Middle School hats on as students what we experienced knowing that that's a really critical developmental time and students brains hormones all of that fun stuff you have to really love to be in the middle school teacher and so with that looking at safety a lot of families and I was one of them not in this District but in general who did not feel that the middle school that my kids were going to be attending was safe because it was just way too many kids classes were full kids were sitting on floors and it just did not feel good and when my kids said it didn't feel good that was a worry as

[01:44:00]
aren't you want to protect your kids so we are looking in the Middle School Task Force at what does that look like what does safety look like and first and foremost how are we communicating what are middle schools what programs they offer what structures they have in place so I don't think we've done a very good job in promoting what are middle schools do have and inviting the community into our middle schools to feel what that feels like but ultimately knowing that relational capacity is number one at any grade level no matter what so our teachers really building those strong bonds of respect with students we are looking at that family model like the smaller Learning Community where the four academic Court classes would have a pure group of students that they would teach so that they

[01:45:00]
put another proposal meet in there a PLC groups to discuss student work behaviors any types of interventions that they need to put in place for certain students and looking at student data and so those are some of the pieces that we were that we discussed but also the issue of you know because our kids have so many needs and are changing so drastically at that Middle School level looking at their mental health the social emotional supports and so we also are recommending the support staff be put in place and be kind of a guardrail so every middle school should have a counselor a social worker a nurse those were calling restorative restorative coordinators to be able to work on building that sense of

[01:46:00]
Hayden community in the middle school where the kids feel like this is my family I know I can go to these adults in my family if I need support and that teachers have a better grasp and understanding of who their kids are and can collaborate with their colleagues to support those kids within that family you know we know that some kids respond differently to different adults and sometimes I would walk past the classroom and see a student throwing things across the classroom and I would like stop and look in the door like what are you doing you would never do that in my class so for teachers to be able to collaborate and problem solve and to bring kids in and support them on a on a different level I think could be really impactful but we have a proposal that we will be bringing soon for you all to look over and we all know that budget impacts all of that but if we know that there is a huge need to support

[01:47:00]
are middle school students and that's where we're losing then we really need to put our focus and really invest our resources in those areas yeah that's great thank you and I agree and so it is helpful to see or hear at least comprehensively strategic vision for how this might all fit together so that it's not just the right size in here and middle schools here and social emotional over there my last is just a comment and not a question so I did mention that the best practice in school right sizing is to give students and families the choice for where they go next but another best practice that I hope we can consider as well is just Navigators four families for in those schools so that they have essentially Navigators counselors to help them understand what's happening to help them understand their options to help them really comprehend everything but also Navigators that extend into the next setting so once a family moves from one school into the next Navigators continue to check in with them

[01:48:00]
how to make sure that the transition has gone well also so that's certainly an expense but potentially a role for school Community coordinators and I do think definitely promising and a huge benefit to know that some of these North Valley schools in particular could now have a librarian and a music teacher in a school Community coordinator because right now they're too small so just wanted to suggest that as another best practice that we might consider thank you so one simple question that I will leave and the city and look forward to hearing that because I think it's important I appreciate the work that's been done on this but it's not just flashing burn and and what does right size

[01:49:00]
real issues with the fact that the chamber and the LFC think simply closing schools is somehow a Panacea for solving all problems and that were and that we are not looking at declining enrollment is an opportunity to give more to the students that we do have and it goes back to you as a Martinez and what Our obligation is to our students we are not in a business this is not a business this is a mission that we have for educating children in being a real substantive part of communities so when we start looking at schools it is not a dollar symbol that we should be looking at but rather really and if I start looking at the overlay of socioeconomic status of communities

[01:50:00]
and where we are talking about closing schools there is a correlation and I think the reality and just knowing Kirkland Elementary yes at school yes it's small and yes its struggles with the issues of how do we have a fully staffed school for a small number of students and that is a reality it is reality I can recognize that but I also know that community and that is the community that has very few access to access points to Community Services it's the community that has huge Transportation challenges it's a community we're having parents ability to walk to school with their child is the only way that they can have that connection with the school and the school recognizes that developing

[01:51:00]
so it is not simple and the impact of the schools that we closed will have an oversized impact on the communities that has those schools because they are schools that overwhelmingly do not have the access to transportation to other Community Resources so and I do and I do do parents desire to walk into the school and know that their child's can be there I mean to go K-8 other communities that have other kinds of challenges looking to 35 and so these are not simple and it's not just a matter of the Navigator I look at Coronado

[01:52:00]
I am very concerned about the way the framework and the conception of magnets and changing Janet Kahn into a magnet changing the given boundaries that include transportation and access Coronado Coronado Springs reduced lunch population is 30% the percentage so we can start setting up very easily incredibly segregated socioeconomic status schools

[01:53:00]
that is what some people want that is not what I think is going to serve our community best and so I would really urge you to go back and look at how do we design a magnet school how do we do that richness of development of curriculum but maintain the community aspect of those schools I don't understand why they have to be mutually exclusive unless our goal is to very intentionally established segregation by socioeconomic status you know Longfellow was developed initially really and truly honoring the Martinez community of this being

[01:54:00]
employment pattern wise taking advantage of parents who drive into downtown and it seems like the same kind of perspective could really be looked at for instance for Kirtland I'm not absolutely categorically opposed to having preschool hubs but I would like to see because we do have some preschool hubs right now and I would like a little bit of an analysis of what does it mean where do the children go when they finish with the preschools what happens to the do they for instance do they go back to geographically where there are other homeschool might be to go someplace else

[01:55:00]
advantages for but I'd like to see a little more thought for it to as far as I'm really confused about this conversation around preschools I mean that's I really appreciate knowing that there's statutory language that says 50% off funding maintains is maintained in private community-based preschools in 50% can be public I didn't know that I think that's really important so there is protection no matter what but the whole point of having preschools is to support the growth and development and success of the children who are in those schools I mean study after study we know that the reason why so many children do not do well is because they do not access they can't access preschool services and the whole point of expansion is to make it possible for those

[01:56:00]
if you can't drive across town who can't access preschool other places in their schools so that they have transportation so that they can get there so that they can tie in to other extended service support for after school programs I mean the whole point is that we know one reason one of the key factors is that so many of our children can't access preschool we have got to open up I mean I think the strongest part of this redesign model is saying that's really make sure we can give support and access to children for preschool my one fear and I think we need to have real programmatic conversations start designing those schools to be doing what we used to ask second graders to do and so I think programmatically I want

[01:57:00]
every preschool to look the way board member popular Romero's preschool looks because it is doing for preschool children what should be done for them and it's looking at developmentally appropriate practice I want that for all kids I want kids at Kirtland at Whittier to be able to access that so I mean this whole thing has been in the in the model of how do we make everything better I think preschool is an absolutely I apologize for that but you know that when we carefully design instructional program when we invest resources when we put good leadership in school

[01:58:00]
return schools that are struggling into schools that we can be truly proud of and so I mean I just want all of this to be focused on how do we do that for every school and that's what the real question is how do we do that for every school so the redesign what I mean we're going to have to work with communities because I'm really concerned looking at Kirtland it's it's a community that does not have resources and their resources have to be supported thank you so I'll try to kind of wrap up where we are I think you've got a lot of questions on the table the only questions that that I have and it's sort of going into this whole thing it's I'm struggling with the report because

[01:59:00]
there's a whole section of this that is funded in a section that's not funded and I can't really tell like what's the cost projection here for how much we have in the bank and what we can actually do and what's not funded and what's the potential to raise those funds like how and what's the timeline for that that makes me nervous because I so with the proposal that dude honest is going to come forward to us for you know to to fund a design I'm like is that like the best use of funds at this point I don't know because I can't see it from the perspective of this plan so we've got this plan and we kind of have to piece it together and the way that it's being proposed to us and pieces just makes me uncomfortable because I don't I don't know if I'm able to say that's the best use of funds at this time or if that's you know the only you know I just need to see it

[02:00:00]
so the the hard part with that and we're certainly willing to adjust as necessary is that one repurposed isn't contingent on the other so they're all very separate and that's why there's not like a comprehensive plan because it's the Duran is repurpose is not contingent on the loose repurpose so the since was the first one kind of that's why that was the design the what's going forward to you is the design of a prototype for the Early Childhood Center and that's with Sr funds okay so that's it's there's nothing that is in that that is connected to construction for it it's the design that prototype would be used for the other ones too but for each one we can't that's why we recommend going through each one individually in different

[02:01:00]
meetings or doing like two at a time because pulling all the Early Childhood together would make sense because they're all different and they're not contingent on each other even to the extent of Early Childhood we're giving you a comprehensive plan of building out 12 Early Childhood centers to also doing one Early Childhood Center so each each one is separate and they're not contingent on each other and I think the other part that concerns me those for those that are unfunded so let's just take a look at the pool game piece every year through these phases is unfunded and so are we really going to restructure because I don't know how we would raise those funds is what's concerning to me and so the timeline is not you know I look at the fourth phase of you know third and fourth of actually opening but we have unfunded pieces here so that

[02:02:00]
that just kind of worries me because I know with this community to in terms of promises made promises Captain how long it takes to get something done of this magnitude is going to be difficult because that construction and that facility at Los Padilla's is pretty old it's it's a it's that's a that's a lift I think in terms of what is out there it's a beautiful piece of property I have no doubt that the vision for using the wetlands and all that's beautiful piece of property as is Polk Polk is a beautiful piece of property but I just I am struggling with that and then I but I think you know with the work group committee we could sort of work through what some of the concerns are that I have from my perspective and what I think the communities perspective are is that also this you know push to new futures

[02:03:00]
get Polk Middle School makes no sense to me at all because I think of young parents and I think of access to what they need in terms of career Readiness and the things that they're going on Polk is not even close enough to anything it's close to a CNM campus there's no doubt if there was some like structuring for that but I just I just can't I can't feel the vision for it so in my heart I'm struggling with that part because I just don't see how that could even be possible just giving the just how far it is from everything because that's a that's definitely a stretch in my mind so for me it's the it's the finances and I think everybody on the board is struggling a little bit with finances and then for one of the things that I'm asking on this too so how does all of this Capital proposal

[02:04:00]
fit with our Capital master plan in the work there are we going to be delaying other projects are we pushing these projects up what happens to that thank you president Yolanda Montoya Cordova as you know the capital master plan of the capital program is in support of the instructional master plan and so you gave a very good example of Oak and folk music investment we are aware in terms of prioritization we need to make a decision right now in terms of what direction we are going so that we move forward into the next capital of the

[02:05:00]
first election will be in 2024 we have collected and assure about what it is that we are building or renovating and how that will be in relation to where instructionally we are going because basically we don't just want to build monuments to our own Eagles you want to build something that will support the overall academic plan and that's why this is being brought at this time I have to talk about that because I know for the community the this community you know listening to this particular restructure for this is going to be it's going to be hard for that Community this is the big it's a big shift for them I understand why we're doing it too at

[02:06:00]
same time cuz I know we're struggling mightily with the size of both schools I mean poke is is really a small it's very small and when it gets that small it's hard to have the robustness and you're talking about middle schools and just the structure that's a beautiful school there's no doubt that they're doing some amazing things but there is still there's definitely a huge gap Los Padres is definitely on the other hand kind of shifted itself because of the Investments we made around the academic side and the programming side of it and it's you know it's it's got a nice feel in terms of the academics but I'm really struggling with it and all of you know I'm sure I'll feel quite a few questions from the community that that's really worried about that and then I just want to say Dr to thank you so much for sharing a piece that you had on the middle school cuz I I agree

[02:07:00]
sweetly that that is where the Gap you know starts to hit with our with the district and I look forward to hearing the proposal in terms of that redesign because it's time definitely is having a granddaughter in middle school right now and hearing some of the struggles is definitely it's been it's been a tough couple of years but we're plowing through it and she's you know it's it's going well but you can see that shift in terms of what happens from you know that K5 space Oh the other question I have doesn't poke I mean they have a Pre-K as well already they do and it's important to know that most of our Pre-K that we have when board member period was talking about the hubs those are our special education hubs so we have a whole side of the developmental preschools and

[02:08:00]
it's kind of hard to figure so if this was going to be changing to what's being proposed because you're also wanting to put a hub in the South Valley either at Polk or at Harrison it just it sort of it just confused me a little bit because I thought we already have one there so the Hub so the Hub is different in different terminology so the current hubs are our District Preschool hubs for developmental preschool and we have future hubs when we talked about the same word using is a comprehensive including the developmental preschool program as well as coordinating for like the city Head Start multiple people use our spaces for

[02:09:00]
preschool so like at Hawthorne I'm familiar with we have the city preschool and we have the an APS Pre-K sight so it's basically bringing them all into the same facility right now it's very if you go on to school campuses you'll see they'll say they're there to pick up their students for preschool but there could be like the city preschool is over here and then the aps preschools over here and then the Head Start program it's basically having all of those when we say hubing okay with these it's having all of those providers together in a facility okay all right and cuz I do find it I mean I'm just want to say to a hub at I think it's being proposed at home I think that's what it says right now I don't understand that one at all just because of the distance from everything I mean that's not even on a major through Affair it's

[02:10:00]
are you know I mean closer to Harrison makes a whole lot more sense because of the traffic patterns but it's far you're starting to get into the little village of Los Padilla's and I do see some similarities around the village concept like you have with Corrales with the K-8 model because it's you know it's a village model it's folks that are from that community that live there they you know I think there could be there there could be interested for sure to have that continuity but I think what's going to be the struggle is because they are already know they have a middle school there and so the community engagement is going to be really critical in all of this and this conversation and a real I think just a reality check in terms of what the real time lines are here because I don't believe especially the timeline for this particular proposal on the table for this one I just I just don't even see it it just

[02:11:00]
what happened that way we can go over them again as individual proposals and the Early Childhood sites as the committee looked at it across the map it was developed with some background and some like Seattle has done it and other large cities is looking at Early Childhood hubs as places on a parent's commute so you'll see some of those are intended to bring in people that might even ideal it's intended on the map to bring in if people are coming from this into town to work it's more on like the thoroughfares Duran is particularly was looked at as far as it being near the interstate as far as parents so the hubs are in necessarily looking at how they are on a like in the neighborhood it was more intended for commute to work Kirtland

[02:12:00]
sample the community has expressed that there's no Early Childhood access if you go towards the base for work so that's where so the hubs and we'll go over it in a more in-depth Early Childhood is designed more in traffic patterns for commuting well and there's definitely that science is there I mean in terms of commuting patterns because we look at it at Workforce just in terms of where people are commuting from and how but that commuting pattern into that particular part of the neighborhood has to be really intentional because you have to come off and Interstate off a major thoroughfare to get into the middle it's not an intentional I mean it's just a bedroom community it's really small and it's not structured for that kind of piece at all which means those folks are commuting out you know and going other places but you don't know

[02:13:00]
you're going to go to Abuelita's to go have a really good you know it's a great you know trip to Abuelita's and then to the whole house you know I just want to put a plug out for that Community because it's really beautiful that way but anyway so I just want to say thank you to for the comprehensiveness of this discussion I think it's been really helpful as a as a first first iteration I know we've asked for the board had asked about right sizing I think for me I will say this also from my perspective when I thought of right sizing I sort of thought like you know cross big District I saw that you took scores but I guess you'd have to figure out like where would you start and how would you start I appreciate the rubric and the pieces that were put in there that makes a lot of sense to me so it was probably the best and easiest way to do a review for everything I was surprised

[02:14:00]
what Rose to the top and what didn't I guess I could say to I'm not surprised that this community in my district would come up I think it's come up many times too I think there's been conversations about the size the small you know what's happening there and the reality of we've got really aging infrastructure at both of those whether I mean Los Padres is so old I don't even know I can't remember when it was so they definitely have some struggles there one more thing I just just so we can have some accurate numbers I'm just on our website and for example kurtland has openings in pre-k Los Pious in conjunction to Polk has openings in pre-k at a 54 of our sites 21 of our Pre-K sites have current opening so we're halfway through the school year and 39% of our sights are not full so that something

[02:15:00]
look at again when we're looking at districts that were proposing to serve and the openings that we currently have at this point that's good thank you all right so thank you so much and I'll come and go there so we're going to do is we're going to go back up to the top and this was where announcement of a right-sizing working group and this is in alignment with the recent committee structure that we had talked about the capital outlay the Coptic and Technology committee is no longer a committee because it's not a standing committee so we're going to create a work group on this particular piece and what I have done on this one is I've asked board member Mueller going to actually chair this one and what I'd like what I thought would be appropriate on this given the the communities that are

[02:16:00]
board member Gonzalez board member Peterson and myself would actually be members of that working group that we would come together with the the district have some working meetings obviously they're still four of us on it so it'll still be announced as regular meetings but and this group on this side would have you could attend if you choose and and not attend but what would happen is on our regular board meetings structure we would have this as as a regular update that the working committee so in this case chair member of the chair of this working group would have some sort of report that you would be making to the committee regularly on that then again we're going to announce the meeting still to be transparent and for all the board members who would want to participate could

[02:17:00]
but this group will be kind of like rolling up my shirt sleeves on on this work so just a point of clarification you use the word committee I mean I keep trying to say it's hard to change its work group board member out of God will report on this working group on where we are and we'll be adding it to our to our regular board meeting as a as an update as an updates are coming through does that make sense any questions on that I don't have any questions on that but I am wondering if we could there were a lot of action items that were kind of discussed during this part and so I would appreciate it if either those action items were restated as to what were were

[02:18:00]
hoping happens or maybe that gets transferred over to board member Mueller Aragon of the action items that are specific for the questions that we have because I'm concerned that there were a lot of questions asked a lot of will get back to you and I just want to make sure that those we got back to use actually happen so one of the things that I can say board member Jackson is that in the way that we're restructuring our minute taking what Johanna King is doing is capturing all the action items in terms of the conversation of what was what we said I'm looking at you and are you feeling confident there that's what she's working on so we're trying to restructure all the way that we're doing our board minutes our minutes so that it captures all that and that will be part of what will be from all of our meetings moving forward is the guidance that we received in terms of coaching around the way that we structure our minutes as well our

[02:19:00]
are meeting is is is is is live and it's recorded So we also put that out for transparency and then when we review the minutes for this particular meeting it'll have all of those action items on it as well but we can also have Miss King go ahead with her action I was still that they're not approved minutes but the action items at least can be communicated and can be rolled up into the into the working group as we move forward unless you have some other suggestions no I am surprised that that's that I'm pleasantly surprised that that is happening I was not aware that that was something moving forward so maybe that's something the executive committee needs to talk about or something so I was informed to that I didn't know that all right so the discussion of upcoming

[02:20:00]
I'm not going to have a discussion do you have something planned for a working group meeting for the next round know that was actually I was just going to ask Mr Ginger how do we plan on the next one is is it a standing meeting or how would you like to schedule them is it I'm going to ask our chair in terms of what would you prefer in terms of a frequency of this working group meeting we're hoping we get to an endpoint right that's why this working group is going to have a began it's going to have an end but the frequency of how regularly you'd like to meet on this does the board have any suggestions on how often you think this work group should meet I don't either I think at this point it seems like there's a pretty long list of things that asked for so it seems like realistically you should let us know what

[02:21:00]
realistic for for being able to pull some of that information together meeting again without that would just make us rehash I think we just have to meet before if we're going to have a report out at a regular board meeting we need to make sure that we obviously meet before that so I would say we schedule the next one like in the month from now and then we schedule out from there and keep so that you're not getting them at the last minute but it would stay on whatever for the day of the week is today just told somebody to have a good weekend so I know it's not Friday so that we at least just have pools on your calendar for it I just have that place holder so that nothing else and it's certainly can

[02:22:00]
take the place of what used to be a standing committee that we called cop right so for now it could be that this is the working group's time in terms of the frequency and what needs to happen there so that would be a way to also structure it the good part here is that it won't be the board of the whole won't need to do that it's still going to have four members on it so we're going to have to go through the trouble of just putting an agenda together so that we know what we're discussing and then that way we'd have that for transparency go ahead and I think the reality is that those of us who have schools that are going to be impacted are going to need to be meeting with the community soon and at this point I mean I think we can say it's in developments nothing is set in stone but I think the reality is we need to figure out how we are going to listen to the communities

[02:23:00]
and and make sure that we do whatever possible one to Italy fears and tea to make sure people have a real honest way to give voice to the process and the committee has been working really closely with the Zone Associates and you'll see Miss Bell here too in a close conjunction with the school principal to make sure that it's connected to that work of the school and through the Zona Associates I feel like the staff and the Community start to that's the best connection I feel to them giving their input and there you have a very good pulse of the school community and I would ask if that if the Zone associate is like if if they're pulling together a community meeting where there's going to be an opportunity to hear the voices of the community that were just made aware of those so that we can be we can attend those sessions and sort of listen to eat whether it's a it's a

[02:24:00]
facilitated conversation around problem-solving around this and getting input and ideas definitely think we should be invited to those so that we could be part of that conversation and when you say that we it's I think we could certainly make it you know just put some broad awareness and of course anyone that's interested in attending and all of us you know anyone who has an interest in that I mean I know it's only one school in my district okay all right any other discussion question mark and if we need to we can always have some coaching on

[02:25:00]
list from the Council of great City Schools to help us with this as we work through restructuring how we do work groups and such so I appreciate everyone's flexibility on that all right so with this I would just say that we are adjourned we don't have to announce an upcoming meeting because we don't know when that's going to be but we're adjourned and thank you ladies and gentlemen for being here tonight
