Aztec New Mexico what comes to your mind I'm

[00:19:00]
I'm sure that most of you are thinking about the horrific event that happened in December where alone shooter shot two Aztec students but I want to change your thinking about that event because of the response at APS did when that happened immediately finding out about the event superintendent Reedy contacted the superintendent and Aztec and said tell us what you need and we will be there so on December 10th 3 days after the event when they still hadn't even opened the schools back up again we deployed six members of the apsd smart team management and Recovery team to ask that was on a Sunday I said even a work day for our December so the volunteers went to Aztec began to work with

[00:20:00]
the community and so during that time they provided assistance to the community to the staff to the students they covered the all of the schools and Aztec not just the high school and did a lot of intervention and then worked with the staff to open the schools school back up again and did those kinds of things so tonight we're recognizing this incredible group of people that wasn't the only thing they did if you remember we went into winter break Aztec was still in school the second week so some additional members of the D smart team gave up part of their winter break to go to Aztec and to provide assistance to help them recover from this horrific event and

[00:21:00]
and I can tell you that and I don't know exactly what Victoria is going to say but I'm going to tell you that there were lots of groups that went our team took the lead and I think Victoria came back with a stack of cards about this thick and they told her your team is fantastic if you ever need us we will come to Albuquerque so I'm going to ask Victoria Reid to join me at the podium who is the lead of the D smart team in APS and ask her to say a few words about the experience and Aztec and then introduce the team members that are here tonight that actually went to Aztec thank you doctor and thank you deeply appreciate the recognition it's been a long day today as well so I'm going to say

[00:22:00]
because we're all quite tired actually most of us that are here today at least half we're working at other schools today for hard things that happened so I apologize if I get a little emotional I'm tired so anyways I want to be sure that we honor the Aztec Community as well they're very strong and resilient and wonderful caring people their teachers are very much like our teachers we heard stories of teachers please sing themselves between gunshots and trying to find weapons in their classrooms and I like to think that are like that so I want to make sure that we honor them is a team we're really honored to have worked with those folks and on that note

[00:23:00]
I want to introduce you to some of the most awesome people that I've ever had the pleasure to work with I'd like to introduce first the two people that went back to Aztec and gave up part of their winter break that would be Molly Covington please come on over here they don't like attention at all it's very painful for them to be here this is Molly Covington she's a nurse at Osuna Elementary School she splits between Osuna and Del Monte please come on over she is a school counselor at Manzano high school counselors at Truman Middle School Kim McClintock is the school counselor at Osuna Elementary School Jamie Anderson is a school counselor at McDonald's

good evening superintendent Reedy and members of the Board of Education I sent you an email this afternoon and in the email I reminded you all that last month about 68 TF member Educators attended the board meeting and 30 of them spoke out about intensifying workload issues at the end of that meeting each of you expressed your support for the employees that came and spoke I want to thank you for that support and when I reported that you were all very supportive and concerned about what they spoke about I was bombarded shortly thereafter with questions about so what's going to happen what's next what's next and I'm here tonight please because we do have an agreed upon

[00:48:00]
stop in the email I sent you I created a timeline of our efforts to professionally and productively address these concerns over time and I wanted to give you that in writing so that we can learn from this experience and make sure that staff concerns are addressed in a more timely way in the future and I think with the process that we've agreed to I think that's entirely possible if you flip to the end of the written packet I gave you which is a copy of one of the things I emailed you today at the very last page after about 20 pages of comments that I got in addition to the people that spoke the other night period

[00:49:00]
what kind of an instructional Council made up of APs department leaders ATF union leaders so that we can work on implementation and planning issues so that practice and policy meet in the middle so that when we need to do something different in our schools we can hear from the practitioners and work on really thoughtful implementation plans after I introduce this to the union reps last night they broke out in Applause they were so excited to see that that was agreed to and then they started immediately asking questions there are many questions that remain and is urgent that we work first to clear up in writing to everybody what is and is not mandated because there's a lot of confusion as you read the employees comments I think that you'll notice that once we clear up those implementation and communication issues with the FBA in the VIP process there are a lot of

[00:50:00]
other issues left to work out in a collaborative process and so I want to just say to all of you thank you very much to superintendent really how much I appreciate the support and the process that we've agreed to and I cannot express to you how optimistic this has made the employees of the district thank you I realize that I was going through this I forgot to read the second page there was a whole other list of things but we got through it so thank you for putting that concludes the public forum Google community members and staff and guests and by saying yes I'm talking about Lily so I think she went to bed though

[00:51:00]
I would like to share with you is that the New Mexico public education department recognized Alamosa Elementary School at the state legislature on Friday January 26th for its effective bilingual Multicultural education program the school was selected for the for the bilingual Multicultural education program recognition award it's not an easy thing to get and it's quite an honor a few of the factors contributing to the growth and success of the Dual language program at Alamosa included hiring highly qualified bilingual Educators and you know how hard that is providing professional development opportunities based on best teaching practices and sound research and forging relationships in the community such as coordinating with the partnership for Community Action to bring the Early Childhood School Readiness and parenting engagement curriculum called

[00:52:00]
abriendo puertas or opening doors into the school system of resources the schools bilingual team is dedicated to empowering students through meaningful in-depth learning in both English and Spanish and the program promotes positive self-identity this is really the Crux of the of the whole project respect for cultural diversity and provides a strong foundation in language and academics we're planning to recognize Alamosa staff at an upcoming board meeting that will be fun I'm very proud of all the bilingual work happening at Alamosa and in the district is a whole and will continue to push to see the work expand if you know of any bilingually certified Educators out there please ask them to come our way more so it's really just a wonderful precious program and we need to grow it and

[00:53:00]
for the sake of our children on Monday January 22nd West miss us Avid team sponsored an 8th grade Shadow day for more than 80 students visiting from John John Adams Middle School Jimmy Carter Middle School Truman Middle School and one student coming all the way from James Monroe Middle School visiting students were able to get a feel for the expectations of high school meet new friends and ask those very important questions it was a great experience for both future Mustangs and current students who had the opportunity to share their knowledge and experience and make those all important connections ABC Community School partnership board will very very soon be naming the next executive director Replacements who ran away to Washington DC

[00:54:00]

[00:55:00]
she earned a master's degree from at UNM in public administration and a public management all all are excellent excellent candidates and we look forward to continuing an active partnership with ABC schools and this is just the beginning of a wonderful relationship so we'll be hearing very very soon as you know hurricane Maria devastated the Puerto Rico School District a district of about 347,000 students who almost all qualify for free and reduced lunch our own John do Faye went to Puerto Rico after the hurricane as part of the Great City school team that was sent to us School damages and Puerto Rico has a very special place in our hearts more than 25,000

[00:56:00]
can you send nearly 200 teachers and their families fled the island right after the hurricane So Not only was it devastated physically but also in its heart the aftermath of the storm continues to hamper the day-to-day operation of schools and it's been months 21 school closed because of the damage 1/3 of the 1,110 schools that remain open have no power whatsoever teachers continue to struggle to get the basic resources that they need to do their jobs including providing food and air conditioners when needed in spite in spite of all the hardships teachers continue to teach and encourage the students in their care they are truly the perfect example of true Educators and their dedication

[00:57:00]
to that is Que Viva Puerto Rico we're right behind them and we will keep you posted as things develop or if we find ways that we can we can support them the human resources department classified Staffing team today had a very productive meeting recently with New Mexico workforce connections the HR team met with the New Mexico Workforce Solutions business management Staffing opportunities for the district's classified positions were hurting for teachers of all kinds of Specialties and were hurting for classifieds to come and help us support the work of the schools the New Mexico workforce connections is a One Stop resource

[00:58:00]
qualified trained and pre-screened applicants we are both very very excited to partner together to assist job Seekers with employment at APS through this collaborative effort the human resources department discussed how New Mexico Workforce Connection can assist the district with Staffing for educational assistance food and nutrition nutrition service employees custodians and various trade and Technical professional positions Human Resources staffers attended a New Mexico Workforce Connection job fair earlier today and they got there on a school bus so we wanted to make sure that everyone you that we had arrived this was an opportunity for the human resources staffers to meet face-to-face with prospective employees who are qualified

[00:59:00]
and ready to work HR staff also were able to directly assist prospective candidates through our application process and answer any employment related questions that they may have we're very excited about working together with the New Mexico workforce connections to assist us with our staffing needs and it's looking more and more like a marriage made in heaven it's going to be great thank you so much so Mr Sadie teacher at Madison Middle School recently invited me to come and speak to his Avid class 7th and 8th grade students were are learning college-ready skills and building an array of strategies to fuel their lifelong education Journey even at that age they're already starting to think of the future

[01:00:00]
the regularly host guest speakers who have leveraged their education into a fulfilling career so during my talk I stress the fact that as I worked my way through education and work I was off and scared and I needed them to hear me say that and many times I thought that I was the only one going through whatever was happening to me at that one time but I wasn't but I didn't know it at the time so I encourage them to run towards challenges not away from challenges I encouraged them to write or to run towards challenges and embrace them because by embracing challenges you really grow into your true selves the students were attentive and when I finished do they had many questions

[01:01:00]
including what's a mentor did I have a mentor how did my mentor help me who I admired I told them my grandma and what's the best way to get a scholarship I just really enjoy that trip and I've heard from them since that my visit and so it's just really wonderful to see that that they might have walked away with some insights that they didn't have before the 9th Annual Festival this was last week I was sick I couldn't make it but the festival is supported by the national Hispanic Cultural Center and the aps Educational Foundation Through The Olde charitable trust dancing music groups from 399 APS and Charter Elementary Middle School's performed at the national Hispanic Cultural Center and participated in workshops on dance music and culture Daniel

Madison Middle School's principal Deborah Garrison has been elected to the board of directors of the children's grief Center of New Mexico Debbie is always giving back to the community and she's a very special individual and I'm so proud that she is part of the aps family and remember Francis Frost she's the family Ambassador at the US Department of Education in an advocate for education and Equity she publicized are APS homework Diner through Twitter you remember her she experienced homework Diner first hand and met with the board on a recent

[01:08:00]
visit her Twitter feed was a great publicity for the work of the students family and Community Support Division and the family engagement departments and our community schools that concludes the superintendent's report thank you very much intervention strategies Chevrolet

[01:09:00]
evening Mr President members of the board superintendent Reedy as you know we are continuing down the path of preparing applications for the MRI CSI and TSI schools and one of the fundamental pieces of the work is really building theories of action behind each school's plan and execution of interventions to meet the root cause of the goals that our schools have set forth in really proceeding accordingly with these applications so tonight we would really like to spend some time discussing the process that has been used in building structuring and developing The Narrative behind the theories of action that are CSI and MRI schools are using to supplement and make up their application and to do that we have Thomas Piper the director of school accountability and support who has been instrumental

[01:10:00]
the work that we have been doing with our CSI and MRI School specifically to guide us through that conversation Mr Piper thank you to be here with you tonight to talk to you about theory of action and the main idea of theory of action came to us through the CSI application the grant for us and it actually we started writing these theories of action for 175 schools and we found it to be quite helpful because it make sure it ensures that we are linking root causes with desired outcomes effectively in our plans and so it's actually become an exercise that we're using with lots of schools as they work on their 90-day plans

[01:11:00]
the theory of action is more than usually usually more than one statement can be a set of sentences or paragraphs and what it does is it links three areas from the 90-day plan the first areas that desired outcome which is also known as a change of adult behavior and what that is is basically what practice will we change in order to meet a challenge that we want to change the the next area is root cause and so the root cause the idea of root cause actually is is coming from the field of business total quality management and successful businesses use it all the time and I have a root cause is that once you meet a root cause if you address the root cause then it will lead to a change automatically so it's a scientific management principle and finally part of the theory of action statement is the goal so

[01:12:00]
for schools that's a lot of times if you thinking about Tier 1 core instruction that's park goal or you know a student learning goal in terms of some of the other Focus areas like School culture or collaboration it could be something else so that's the sum of theory of action and the theory of action is the area that we're asking schools to really interact with us as we do these applications a lot of the areas of the application we are actually working as a team in the district level to write but these areas have been useful for schools and you know their localized in their contacts the the way that this is related to even more to these applications is that the applications are ask for an evidence-based intervention and we were as we research intervention is it's

[01:13:00]
something that needs three tiers of evidence and basically their programs programs that have a research base in them that have been proven to have an effect a measurable effect so when they're applied in a school and there are several programs and approaches we mentioned Avid tonight as it is one of those programs that meets several Focus areas and I'll just mention it briefly Avid so there are 10 Focus areas for 90-day plans and there's about these 90 Day plans the teams are supposed to choose two or three Focus areas that they feel would lead to the greatest impact one of the required Focus areas is tier one intervention so Avid meets the requirement for tier one intervention in terms of its research in other words

[01:14:00]
Memphis score to use Avid with Fidelity then they would see a measurable change in tier one for instructional in the areas of school culture and collaboration so you can kind of think about this as a lot of things that were throwing around here but the idea is that a few strategies can actually meet several Focus areas and that's the main idea that we wanted how do you think about tonight as we're working on 90 Day plans and the CSI Grant applications thank you Mr Piper as you know we will be before you at essentially every committee and board meeting rolling out pieces of information as this is a mega project around the MRI applications including the DSs directions to two of those

[01:15:00]
categories next meeting we will be really rolling out and beginning to share with you the narratives that schools are working very hard on composing we have our CSI and MRI schools applications being populated written and developed on a minute-to-minute basis throughout the last several weeks and at our next meeting we're going to specifically share with you the theories of action and components of the applications that make up the MRI the three MRI applications to have a really in-depth conversation in reference to Los Padilla's Whittier and Hawthorne Elementary schools with that we stand for any questions that you may have at this point in reference to the airport mentioned designated schools

[01:16:00]
strategies can meet many Focus areas so is this going to be one of your priorities in to just focus on a few strategies and scale in particular for us we are looking at our research team is actually looking at a few strategies that are that have been used for that are commonly used in order to meet the requirements of focus areas so for example for common ones would be assessments data wise continuous Improvement systems which is often and wicker strategies as well as the tripod student service which measures 7 C's

[01:17:00]
after you look at the three schools because each School of course is going to be different than you will decide which of those would work better in which school correct these strategies can be used in both MRI and CSI applications but when we're talking about these interventions the the main concern for us is to fulfill the CSI application there seems to be a separate process which the superintendents can speak to regarding MRI application and that process okay so they can be used to cross all of the MRI and the CSI schools okay great so we'll just have a little bit more about the theories of actions be able to tell us especially about the MRI schools how your what is planned about changing adult Behavior about the root cause and about the goals so they'll be more specifically as

[01:18:00]
superintendent really thank you yes we will continue to unpack this idea and you will see theory of action as a section in each of the applications that you review thank you very much as how we address what's going on in the schools in the right way and there's been a lot of community voice staff voice and even student voice and I think that's really critical looking at root causes and trying to not just your kind of you know easy this is this is the

[01:19:00]
purple and all we have to do is put thousands of dollars into some magic program that doesn't exist but I do have I do have concerns about the assessments that go along with this and when I hear iStation being the focal point in the interventions and progress monitoring coming from iStation I just I'm a reading recovery teacher and I spent 15 years of my life being a reading intervention teacher and I have real concerns and I know some of that is out of our hands but I just think we need to really look at sound models for what kind of interventions and the the the the the the assessments need to align with good instructional practice and really informing good instructional practice so I mean I think that we're on track with the process but I

[01:20:00]
is a professional and I know we're not supposed to get into the weeds as board members but I think it it directs us when when we take it so evidence-based is too frequently I think misused I mean we can create Circles of saying okay we're using Istation for assessment so I'm going to create my instructional intervention for something that I know will show up on Ice Station and we create this Loop and lots of times the evidence base stop research is being done by the exact people that are Marketing in particular tool rather than something that's really peer-reviewed in actual scientific research documentation and best practice and

[01:21:00]
I understand that we've got to juggle what's in our control and what's not in our control for for what gets approved but I really hope that one of the things that we can keep our eye on is really and truly what is good practice and what assessments can we use to to indicate growth or not but let the good practice the good content the good instruction in the standards guide for the assessment comes from rather than vice versa thank you I'm going to let you have a comment if you have any comments please

[01:22:00]
it's gone into thinking about this and I'm I'm curious and sort of scratching my head about some of what was said I didn't get to hear it all real well hopefully I can review the minutes in the reports that it has been prepared for us this evening unfortunately I'm not able to be there is a very interesting issue I understand that calculations

[01:23:00]
I don't know I haven't seen any analysis of these different populations and what's happening within these populations there are other things that concern me family stability you know are families needs to be heavily emphasized Bureau

[01:24:00]
it was very impressed and encouraged to hear about our relationship with Workforce Solutions that's being created my hope would be that part of the interventions would look at some of these core root cause issues that I didn't hear in your analysis I I am concerned that part of what's happened is we are using data of it in my mind is question mark

[01:25:00]
based on a fabricated crisis and I don't deny that we have need to improve in all of our schools but I think the factors are multiple and the core root causes include things like poverty hunger unemployment the effects of certain issues and families lives like addictions all of those things are important to try to understand as we as we begin to tackle this and I have to say that it has to be something that engages family members parents and students themselves on these things as well those are my comments thank you hey Google I'm still fairly new on the board and I'm trying to grasp all these things like

[01:26:00]
it feels like we're just approaching everything from like this real akademia to you know in terms of like best practices and a guidance for this and I know that there's like a portion of this that just really takes into account that these are real people these are real schools these are real communities and you know the unfortunate part is that I know that there's this stress you know from the public Ed Department in terms of the way that the application is made up and what's required from us to actually fill the boxes if you will and so I'm hoping that as we're going through this process because I you know I continue to look at it from like a perspective of you know like from a social work you know Community capacity building and what are we leveraging and what are we actually going to be you know doing because I I get the thing around we have to figure out how to evaluate and how to like assess progresses we're moving along but I'm hoping that part of that also includes you know some sort of the human aspects of it that's also going to resonate

[01:27:00]
play the community and also for the students and the families that it's not just the performance test and the pieces that are you know that somehow get lost in translation I think for families and especially for students because if all you see is that you're not performing well that you're not doing okay on things it also becomes just a real Downer and it doesn't create a lot of energy or enthusiasm to like stay the course and keep moving and moving towards progress and so I also you know appreciate the work that's going on but I'm hoping that we can also come to some way of how were articulating what we're doing to that it's all so that it's articulated well enough for the communities to understand it you know I am the community in a way and I'm really having a hard time still following what we're planning to implement and and how

[01:28:00]
it's going to look and I think that's important and I'm being honest I'm you know I'm not I'm not a seasoned educator but do I need to be you know and so neither our families and neither are students and so I think we need to just think about it that way too let's try to make it like real so that it's something that we can all hug we can all grasp on and we're all like yes I can I can do that I can support that that that's the only thing I have to say hey Google

[01:29:00]
what affects many things not just one thing so if I may I may start with something called an assessment and I want it to be better proficiency English language proficiency I want to be better that maybe that's an issue I have right so I work my way down to say well what a direct causes for that well kids not coming to school oh okay that's probably affects it or maybe his language issues or maybe he has learning disabilities that might directly affect his ability to score well on a some kind of a test drive

[01:30:00]
response to intervention may be very individual even though what you're trying to do is to find out what are some commonality in those causes that would not only help this kid but that kid and that kid next week and so I hope that's what we're we're looking for me looking about it but it's okay cuz I think again that's part of the investigation of what we have to do so

[01:31:00]
look forward to hearing that sing some real examples for example Los Padres what's a root cause my last it is give me one or tell me you know I'm nice and now but I'm just saying when you when you find it if you find it and then tell me how is that going to affect a lot of things the interventions you're doing are trying to say if I address that root cause I'm going to get a lot of effect everywhere I got to leverage this not not wanted at the time and hope that I can help one another so I'll be interested to know when you find to get some of these things and you get an actual lineage of of what the effect you want what is the root cause how's that going to stop and intervention here and I hope it works I got a problem

[01:32:00]
get uncomfortable feeling about is that I got an intervention and I sure hope I got a problem here this works on you know and I've tried that too by the way you know sometimes it works but so yeah thanks thanks a lot I think again we're on to a lot of interesting discussions and I hope that again our perspective of what we think it is that we want to get to is what we want to end up with I mean that may help that may end up being something the public education department wants to I don't know but I think the question is what's right to do for us and what is Right outcome for us and if it if it gets us to the point of scoring

[01:33:00]
thank you very much appreciate your comments and I'm very appreciative of the staff and their hard work because they really truly taking their time so that we don't have a checkbox you know something to check off at the same time that we find something that is useful for for the uniqueness of the schools that were working with and

[01:34:00]
I can honestly tell you it's very been very difficult but very good thoughtful conversations are taking place with the schools and the staffs and I know we're meeting daily with not daily but weekly again just so that we have this perspective of you know the teachers not only the teachers at the schools but the teachers as a whole and I think a lot of good will come from this thank you very much I appreciate that we'll go on to the consideration and applications

[01:35:00]
in front of you the assurances that are for each of these applications so just a reminder the assurances are the same but the applications that you'll see in the upcoming weeks are different so just to remind you that MRI or the applications from Whittier Hawthorne and Los padillas and those assurances are connected to the redesign all three schools picked option for which was to significantly redesign and restructure their school the CSI schools are the 17th that have come before you that are CSI despite their if they ask for money so that application for CSI schools is asking for money for interventions and then the TSI are 37 schools and the DSs which is a direct student support is asking for money to support direct student support for the TSI schools

[01:36:00]
so it's up to your pleasure of the board as to if you want to adopt those assurances altogether or if you wanted to separate them there's the same assurances but you'll find them on different applications when you review them in a couple of weeks so I just have a quick question so were these assurances are mandated by whom these are mandated by the public education department as part of the grant so when we submit the grant we have to have the assurances signed in order to send them up to Santa Fe okay so the five bullet points are all mandated by the public education department for every District it's going to be exactly like this yes there are particularly issues for

[01:37:00]
Ouija board member with one of the bullets you can mention that it's fine if you want to vote against it that's fine we if we as a board supported over all of the majority then we as a board supported even though individuals may not support it I also think you know the only one that in reality bothers me a little bit so let me give you let me give you an interpretation whether I believe the ones we have are the right ones are not ask me that question right I know what they want to have here but in reality I do believe they're important I think they're useful if they're done

[01:38:00]
and if in fact they're used for the right things so this is going to be a long process here we're talking about three years so we're talking about the opportunity to make it right depending upon how in fact things go in the future and so you know I'm willing to live with that idea in my own personal opinion not necessarily saying I agree with everything in the public education Department's doing but I do agree with some of the things that we have to do to show some kind of progress and some kind of growth is how do we do that right what is student proficiency what is school growth I mean that's just because if the assessments don't really tell us the problem and we may believe in certain assessments that in fact

[01:39:00]
ass

[01:40:00]
this is but I think again for the most part if I interpret it the way I want to I can live with some of the things you know now that may still not be true for everybody but you know I'm trying to make it so that this is not just a point a point solution but this is this is a solution that we're trying to work over a period of time and we should think of this as an opportunity for us to look at how we really improve all of our schools this isn't just about this is about how do we really look at our kids and how do we really make it better for all of our students you know and so I think if we do it right and if we learn right and if we do the right things in terms of what we're looking at and then we will get the kind of results we want to get and whether it's everybody's

[01:41:00]
that's kind of how I interpret these things you know I know that that may be not the exact interpretation that's being put out by those that are mandating it but that's okay with me cuz I'm willing to talk to them about that I'm willing to say look we can have some disagreements about that but the basic principles here are not bad you know the basic principles are not bad and if we can interpret that right and if we can do it right then I think we'll be okay so that's kind of how you know my thought about it rather than trying to get into too many people's interpretation of it but I want to kind of more General interpretations you know who knows the changes may have happened things may happen you know I I suspect they make you know because there may be different people who are leading the public education department

[01:42:00]
I still think that we can do things right for us and so that's kind of my thought on it and other people you know what I agree with you and I think the one who mandates this also has their own interpretation of different things of course but I agree with you on that I also had a problem with that bullet yeah but I agree with you on that long strategic kind of vision and if we really want to get support you know to do the things we want to do then to some extent were compromising a little bit you know I mean we may think there's others like we're giving everybody

[01:43:00]
well and you know I mean again what assurances are we getting from the public education department other than okay we're getting some funds let's say but but how about the help and the collaboration that we need to have to make sure that as we progress here and we may flexible change things how we do it let's work together on this you know what I mean so that we get what we both need to have and and so hopefully that's part of the agreement whether it's the way it really is at this point is that's that's where we got to go with it you know so that we can make it a little more positive and then we can make it something that we can get behind and say that's that's make sure that we do a good job of what we're trying to do here not not a let's just check the box office

[01:44:00]
I don't want to hear from that's what I'm talking about when I talk about the root cause of service I want to know what you're talking about here not that I want all the details but you know how does it really work and then we'll see how the progress works you know in terms of how we're working with that and so that's kind of how I look at the insurance company has the ability to answer that because it's it's a decision that's outside

[01:45:00]
I think we just continue to pursue what we know is best for our schools and put it forward and stand by that and collaborate whenever we can no matter what we do they're the ones who are going to set the cut store they're going to be the ones that are going to decide what's proficient and what's not proficient and where where schools should be and by what tool I think that we need to make sure that we're doing what we know is right for students in our schools and we've got in the voice I mean the fact that for the 3mri schools that those communities are committed to their schools they are committed to keeping those schools their schools and working to to really truly address needs and I think the work that's being done is trying to do that so I mean I can I am

[01:46:00]
comfortable to the extent that it's possible to be comfortable with this to say let's we'll support it will vote for it but it's in process that we have we only know what we know my country moving forward that things can get changed just like when they say oh the evaluation we're going to do this we're going to do something different I mean we just need to have that things are not going to change I want to share and says just kind of said that I want to answer is from The Zone superintendent and the superintendent that they're going to be looking at the child that the child those are kids those are people and they're not just not looking at these programs I mean because I'm not a big person you know big for Ice Station just being a kindergarten I mean that's not something I'm all for but I want this doesn't work are you going to put

[01:47:00]
your job on the line look what we do look what we do all the time and it all comes back to us and they can kick me out next year and say Hey you weren't thinking about the kids first I just think we're always giving saying yes we're giving these assurances but we never get anything and I think sometimes we have to step up and say I'm done like doing this I'm done but that's just me I know how I'll vote but you know period in response to your question about what would happen if you don't sign the assurances it's not as nebulous I think that if you were to not sign the insurance is for the MRI the three MRI schools we would not be able to submit an application for the public education department would pick one of the four options if you were not to sign the assurances for the CSI schools or the Tsai DSS that it would mean that the schools would not be eligible to receive the funding so

[01:48:00]
that's kind of what would happen if you don't back you in time the assurances to make a motion for the consideration of approval of the insurances for MRI CSI and TSI OK Google and we give you a reasonable plan which in fact I hope you're working with them all the time so that they know what it is we're doing that it will be accepted you know that's part of the part of the deal here and so we're committing to these things and then these things and you're putting together a good plan I don't think it's up to the public education

[01:49:00]
that's part of what we need to make sure that we make a point that we expected to be in fact accepted and how much funds we get with that well that depending on how much fun they have probably but I'm just talking about the acceptance of our plan so call for question we have a motion and a second let's do a roll call on that just to make sure we've got a roll call okay no are you with any comments I'm sorry

[01:50:00]
and it feels like a little bit like Russian Roulette not knowing the results once we say yes we'll do this so I'm concerned if a particular school is having difficulties let's say for example with proficiency because I'm not so sure that I agree with that concept but if a school makes for example advances a group of students Advanced two grade levels up to but not the grade level I'm just wondering if we could ask for a dialogue

[01:51:00]
consistently by this Administration and it continues to be under my but I think what the superintendent have expressed before is that you are working closely with those departments within ped and you have a verbal assurance that you are on track and not necessarily with the MRI but you have those Rubik's in those benchmarks on those other applications and so you have a sense of assurance in the fact that you're working closely with those departments within the ped that assist you with this and that you are on track with your application in your ideas and your and your theories and I think the plan is so should detail what kind of growth what kind of things were talking about so we're not necessarily being restricted by what the public education department in terms of that plan and what it is we were saying we're going to make progress in terms of this kind of thing so in terms of Lorenzo's example if that's the kind of progress we think would be reasonable to make

[01:52:00]
and we can do that and that was what we would commit to try and do that doesn't mean that things may not change I think again we've got to be flexible in terms of of things I don't look good in particular way then we we have an opportunity to say we can change that and that's part of the plan probably but so anyway Lorenzo so you have a chance to vote plus a chance to say what you said something else well I think they're doing that all the time the question is do you want to have them with us as a board or do you want to have that stuff

[01:53:00]
add into consideration first okay we're providing the insurance services in the sense that the staff is going to be dialogue with us every you know quite a bit but we're not getting it with TV show yeah it's a reasonable request you know if we think that it would be useful to have those staff at the public education department come and talk with us about what these assurances mean and exactly what it is we expect change the applications you're going to receive one for each school so you'll have the three MRIs a separate applications and then the 17th high schools the public education department does provide

[01:54:00]
technical assistance if we have questions there's a rubric for the CSI so we do have a pretty good road map as far as if we're along the right track but as far as the MRI they don't provide any assistance on telling us whether we're on track they provide technical assistance if we have questions about the applications so that we say this is what we think it is and hopefully you guys will agree because we've talked with you about it anyway what will continue so says yes go ahead with the roll call with the application process and search me yes vote means that we're going to continue with the work that's being done and continue developing what will be submitted in the application and

[01:55:00]
add policy and instruction next week this will come back yet again and I think at that point they'll be more detail in the actual applications and I'll have more opportunity to see what it looks like but I think we've got to be able to keep moving forward in that application process and the work with the schools okay so what is your name OK Google

[01:56:00]
okay so with a lot of comment and I think again you're right but just to make the mention is that we still have these plans that we have to basically approve and so hopefully we'll understand better what we mean by those plans and if those plans follow the kind of things that we believe we can we can adjust to then and if that goes through with the public education department will then that's maybe another way that we can look at how we we want to support and with our insurance is so okay thank you go on to the last item here and that's a legislative Mr President from Santa Fe things are going as well as can be expected update the house

[01:57:00]
what did pass their budget it is in the Senate the house version of the budget included two and a half percent salary increases for teachers 2% increases for all other personnel and it also increases the minimum salary for teachers to 36000 44054 there's a couple of other bills out there on teacher salaries that we've been watching not have made significant movement but all increase significantly we just are going with that number cuz that's what was based in the budget and that's what we know we're adequate we would be adequately funded for the Senate will start their budget work they've been working on it but they'll roll some things out most likely this weekend and so we're keeping our eyes on that we're tracking almost

[01:58:00]
pieces of tracking 300 pieces of legislation about 700 bills have been introduced on page two you should note Senate joint Memorial 21 sponseller request does does ask the legislative education study committee the legislative finance committee and the center for educational policy research at the University of New Mexico to study the costs and benefits of redistricting a large school district that committee are this

[01:59:00]
play Memorial has received two referrals in the Senate it was introduced on January 29th and at this point has not received a hearing so we have had some positive conversations with the sponsor and so we continue to watch that on the third page we are tracking as I said several hundred bills but I provided you an analysis of some of the significant bills that we are really paying attention to and I also provided you the location at this point a lot of these bills have a really hard time getting through the other chamber just the way the legislature is moving and so they're also making some major changes to the bill to try to get them to move so for example today you will see

[02:00:00]
how to spell 86 was the which is the school bus replacement and contract bill the original bill would have changed how often we replace our school buses from 12 Years to 15 years what they did today and Committee in which we supported is that it would leave it up to school districts if you had a bus that you wanted to run over 12 years and it was a good operating condition you'd be able to submit a waiver to the PED to make it last longer and that may be something we would want to do if a bus was running low miles and at 12:30 they were only at 100,000 miles instead of the 300,000 that's typical for a 12-year bus so that's just an example of kind of what's going on to try to get some of those Bulls Bills moving so I stand for any questions but things are looking good OK Google

[02:01:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:02:00]
talk to Dale with some of the not so good legislation and I know you had a couple of questions on some specific bills and I'm prepared to answer I was supposed to do that in my update and I forgot so Mr Melendez is going to be mad at me the cemetery that would basically open the door for vouchers and it looks like they're not going to get scheduled yes the those two there's two bills 2411 credits those bills are very complicated and in the Senate they've been rolled over for a hearing because they

[02:03:00]
we're just too complicated and the Committees were approving them in the house they were scheduled today they were removed from the schedule so they have not made significant movements I wanted to mention that you may have been aware of House Bill 180 which is the which is the administrative costs Bill essentially from New Mexico that has been three or four times I made some changes in that bill that we know that they're going to propose for some charter schools and from smaller schools but they didn't make any changes for the larger school districts so I think again there's not a lot of time to get that bill through I wish they would simply look at this right now we did talk to

[02:04:00]
representative Latin yoga and provided him that information which was very helpful so the one other thing and I think this is for important for any of us who are talking to legislators the increases the salary increases certainly anything at this point is you know Hallelujah that it's at least on the table but I think it's really important for legislators to realize that it's not just teachers that work in the district and that we have speech language pathologist we have nurses we have a whole array of absolutely critical certified people who we need we need the funds from Santa Fe so that we maintain the Integrity of all of the certified people who work in our district and serve kids but more

[02:05:00]
isn't that I think the most outrageous thing is that that means that the people who are lowest paid would also get the lowest percentage of race talking about 2% when we have EA's bus drivers custodians all the people who make the least in this district and providing a 2% raise means that not only not only is it not as high as a percentage but it's a real kittens and legislators I think somehow don't process they say teacher and don't realize that is a very specific category of human being in schools and we need I think all of us need to make sure that we're talking to them to make them realize that it's a team that makes schools work and that to give an EA a smaller percent

[02:06:00]
message then a teacher is just mind-boggling plus where are we going to come up with the money for for any of it if we're not including all certified staff with the 2.5 and they need I think they just need to hear that from us over and over again because they seem to not understand Mr President and board member Peterson yes we have carried that message as well in fact sometime over the past week I think the CWA from a lot of our maintenance and operations and so we got to speak with them and tell them an update and we use some of their stories to tell the exact same thing that you said so you know it's all a collaborative effort and doing our best I have

[02:07:00]
you are doing everything you can to convey that message it just might be good to have a few more voices and that'll be a good time for you to emphasize this next few days especially in the Senate side so thank you I got a couple of questions notification via text what do you think's going to happen to that I have trouble with that since we have a lot of parents who is plans I mean they can't afford it and so I have trouble with them asking districts to do this when they're not putting the money it's like another so I just don't understand why we want to do this but whatever do you know where that's going to go or what do you think so Mister president

[02:08:00]
somebody has not been scheduled for the house education yes but minority leader Gentry did put half million dollars in House Bill 2 to fund that project now we did have a conversation with him if that bill does not move there will still be the appropriation and so he would like to work with us on a pilot to see how we could we could do this so we've had great dialogue with him and so we we've been really open to it and so it's been it's been a good conversation and he was really eager to have the good dialogue that we've had on it so he was surprised that we were even supporting him well that's good the other thing is on the additional graduation requirements

[02:09:00]
just keep adding more to more to kids more to staff at schools so we I mean the kids have to pass take all the classes I have to have to pass all those classes then they have to get a certain score and then now they're going to have to do this and not that I don't think that it's a good idea in a way but not to make it part of a graduation requirement I think if if kids can get counseling and go hey have you ever thought about college and they've never thought about it that's a very good thing but to just add layer upon layer upon layer of kids and expecting more from from our staff to make sure that all of these things are to I can't imagine the concerts at the schools at the high schools being able to do all of this and make sure they check to make sure they apply to school that they are in the military that they have an internship where is that going to go mister president

[02:10:00]
play Osborne 22 in Nashville Tennessee we don't expect those bills to make it with the time but again we've had really good dialogue with minority leader Gentry about the implementation and how we do that if it were to pass and with the aligned with the next step plan we've had really good input from from our curriculum and instruction department and assistance for collaboration and conversations don't have a lot of chance because so at least it's not just a know it's what can we do to work together and so that's good points in both those bills there's some really good things that I'm totally and completely

[02:11:00]
I mean it's not just the software which phone where is it going to come from so it's not just the money but the text message who's going to do that where's the free time for teachers teachers are already struggling to have time to contact parents to have meaningful communication and to put one more like I think it's beyond just the cost which is huge but it's also the reality

[02:12:00]
can you hear me yes I can hear you okay I think pretty much all the concerns that I have been raised thank you okay thank you baby yeah I think they've been voiced by everybody here I personally don't see any implementation capability for HB 22 and 23 we're already doing an awful lot of the same things in both of those in the manner that we can do that you know notifying parents having information doing the fastest stuff for the students you know helping them with with their next plans and so forth to make it a requirement let's say for a graduation give me a break New Mexico so appreciate what you guys are doing thank you very much Joseph and keep us abreast and

[02:13:00]
we will be up there tomorrow or the next day some of us so let us know what we need to do okay as well Mr President and board members and superintendent Miss Yeager and Mr Melendez and I already have a schedule for you so okay expect you to be on time OK Google

[02:14:00]
oh I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry approval of consent items yeah we have a couple just a couple of consent items that came out of our policy and finance so do I have a motion thank you board member comments to go to the Festival Festival I stayed until about 10 after 6:00 and just thought the parents should still go in first so it's

[02:15:00]
obviously was extraordinarily successful and so we may want to have more than more performances I think I mean with 39 schools that's a lot of parents and grandparents so you know I wish I could have could have got it but I couldn't I want to say congratulations to all the newly promoted police officers and thank them for their service to to our community of children we're always indebted indebted to you the tobacco-free I mean that's something to look at I don't know I kind of looked at it really quickly it doesn't seem like too much too many changes are there very simple so I don't think that's a bad thing but I remember when I was at West Mason School the students had a smoking section imagine that today and the teachers did with the students did I was like I remember that when I was in high school another thing that we had talked

[02:16:00]
when we were talking about the homeless students and we had a little report about about that so I called the Secretary of CYFD and what I found out something that I think I needed to make sure to pass on to superintendent Reedy is that it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we report these homeless students as this is considered abandonment neglect abuse and so if we know who those students are we have got just like any of us if we saw a child it is up to us to make sure that we report that so if we do know who these children are there is lots of services that they can receive from CYFD so I want to make sure that I know that we were told that they had other more important things to do that's the most important charges making sure kids are safe

[02:17:00]
so we need to we know who those 4000 and some kids are that are homeless and we need to make sure and pass those names on especially they said those children who are unaccompanied minors the other thing I kind of wanted to to go over and kind of tell a little story about a young adult that's his case was heard this past week he was a young adult and got in trouble he pledged to aggravated DUI and this is back in 2007 his sentence was 90 days and he was supposed to serve that in 2008 he asked his lawyer when he was supposed to go and report to jail and his lawyer didn't really know exactly because there wasn't a firm date and he said he would take care of it so this young very young man just went about his

[02:18:00]
play got a job he was also English was not his first language so there may have been some miscommunication there but he went about his life got a job got married bought a home never got in trouble again this is 2007 well he got stopped at one of the checkpoints so this child this young still pretty young young man I guess what they can do is he wasn't drinking had said he hadn't been drinking but they can still check on them that's up to the discretion of the police officers so they went and ran a check will of course he had a bench warrant back from 2007 so of course he was arrested got a lawyer went to court and the judge listen to him and saw

[02:19:00]
what a wonderful job he had done with his life you know never got in trouble again and he should have imposed not only those 90 days but the fact that he didn't even go turn himself in but the judge said you have made a really good life for yourself and for your your family and so he said go out and keep on making that wonderful future so I thought that was a really good thing for us to think about when we're thinking about about giving out punishment when it comes to the Volcano Vista and high school altercation that took place the week before last a lot of those children most of them were not fighting they were not throwing physical punches they were in like kids are we have to remember that kids are kids they don't think

[02:20:00]
who sings like we do and so when we're giving out punishment let's make sure that we think about how those kids have have lived their life before we go and suspend them and some of these children were were athletes who were given a 5-day 3 or 5 day suspension even though everything was caught on was caught on camera and everything's posted because that's what kids do now but the parents were not allowed to look at the video because there were other other children involved but in this day and age we can you know block out those faces so a lot of those would have been able to exonerate some of these children what I saw is that some of these athletes obviously have to keep their grades up they have to do certain things in their health to a higher standard than those who may not be involved in any extra curricular activities they were some of them

[02:21:00]
cold that they couldn't participate in competition that kills some kids those kids that are athletes are that in are in the Arts a lot of them go to school just for that our job is not to destroy a future it's to help make one so when we are doing that let's make sure that we look at how that child has lived their life before we impose a punishment that really could destroy them thank you thank you so actually just kind of thinking about that some of the rules are the Athletic Association

[02:22:00]
list for a lot of kids so it's yeah so they think about that I do want to just give a shout out to the aps police though because I think any any Educators that deal with the school police find that they really do have an orientation that supportive of kids and it really thinks about the community that they serve and so I really appreciate the festival you absolutely have standing room only and it's really amazing it was

[02:23:00]
it was a wonderful event but it was followed up by that same night Zia Elementary School had its own dual language class performances and once again so I went from the Hispanic Cultural Center to Zia and it was absolutely jam packed standing room only you know don't ever let anyone say that parents don't care about their kids cuz you have something that is worth coming to and parents are there in front of the things that I think we need to think about is a district is how do we use that to to engage parents to a different because parents are there for their kids and their kids were amazing both places it was wonderful I got to be interviewed by a Cub Scout from San Diego base and so just

[02:24:00]
just a couple of observations one is that they really liked Sandia base and having ndi only for 4th grade is not sufficient they're one of the schools that Partners up with the national dance Institute but unfortunately only 4th graders get to participate and it's what he definitely wants it to expand and I don't know how we can do that but it's something to think about maybe with that 15,000 the one criticism he said repeatedly that the world's best burger is not and had serious concerns about the hamburgers

[02:25:00]
let's see the Stress Management in recovery team not just going to Aztec but I have a close friend who's a teacher at North Star and they just lost a teacher and one of the things that she talked about was how incredibly wonderful the response team is and really appreciated that work and finally thank you again for all the work that's being done did he sneaked out I think I think our Congressional Delegation is in need of hearing our voice though because a lot of support that was going to Puerto Rico is being halted and clearly the Reconstruction of schools isn't isn't where it needs to be but more than that and this was in one of the national connections that we

[02:26:00]
that Puerto Rico is looking at following in New Orleans Footsteps in privatizing turning over to Charters their public school system and if anything New Orleans is proven that is a path to not go down and so I was horrified to see that you know when you look at the kind of support the public schools can put together to to abandoned in Puerto Rico at this point I think it's unconscionable and so that's something that our Congressional Delegation I think needs to hear this increase the support that we need to thank you I'll go to the phone to Garcia

[02:27:00]
I'm glad that we have a chance to hear each other out and I appreciate it if you want to listen to what I have to say My Hope Is that we can continue to pull together as the board and hopefully we begin the process where we can identify things that we can do to building a dialogue with me a very

[02:28:00]
important intervention in a school and we will see big changes I have all confidence in this stuff I am concerned about the idea that we would take some some folks teachers more it's a half a percent but I just feel like that sends the wrong message to our stuff to me whether it's the custodian or the EA or the Food Service staff the maintenance staff and I would hope that we would try to find a way to

[02:29:00]
communicate to our legislators that the giving one group a little bit higher than another group it just doesn't make sense thank you thank you very much I just want to say that you know with all the presentations tonight it just reminds me of how well-rounded the experiences are you know and APS and it definitely want to express my gratitude for the damart team when I was over at the Department of Health you know what are the initiatives that I was responsible for was around school mental health and also Suicide Prevention and it was always the aps team that was Rising shining star for us and it was one that we LED with other school districts in terms of how it was organized and the way that the response could be done so I just it's great to see that that

[02:30:00]
that effort is done the staff that do that I know they commit a lot of themselves personally in that process and it's not you know it's it's not easy work so I really appreciate the effort that they've done I want to give a special shout out also I had an opportunity to participate in job shadow events this week you all know I'm with Workforce Solutions and so we were engaged with job shadow events for students one of the ones that happens specifically was the Rio Grande students actually came to our office and we had I think like 30 to 40 students that came through our office and had an opportunity to engage with the different departments and were involved in some interviewing skills they got to meet on the different departments talk about the jobs that we were doing in the kinds of work that they could have and then we also held a little event for them to just to learn about some of the tools and the

[02:31:00]
horses that we had the teachers that were engaged in that project were amazing all the stuff that came and supported that subsequently we will run an internship program for some of the students that will actually get hired through our agency and will have an opportunity to work but I also had an opportunity to meet the group from Manzano at another event where they were over at Wells Fargo and those students had an opportunity to to run through the financial institution and being engaged in some mock interview and resume development so it was great the teacher from that program was amazing as well so just just a shout out to that because I I wish we had a whole lot more of that with some of our other schools and I'm sure there's Junior Achievement activities that are going on districtwide but just great great opportunity for that in terms of the 24/7 campaign to I'm always going to hang on the side of house what I really

[02:32:00]
enjoyed about that presentation is and I think it's important for us to hear is made by young people who are talking about something that is important to them about how you know they see health and on the things that they want to contribute to to making our campuses smoke-free and really understanding that so I I agree I think we need to take a look at that and what that campaign entails and how maybe we is one of the largest districts can follow the other districts that have adopted this campaign and what does that mean and then finally my last comment is just you know started into this whole notion you know APS is one of the largest employers in the state and so the work you know with the Workforce Connection office it's incredible because that is an opportunity to put you know the face of the largest one of the largest employers into the community so that people can understand what APS does and how it works but I also agree in terms of we have a

[02:33:00]
responsibility is one of the largest employers to also ensure that we're also advocating on behalf of all of our employees to because I am concerned about the wages for those that you know are coming in and it's not a sustainable wage and and one of the things that you know we're concerned about for families as we're moving through is that we want to make sure that they have sustainable wages so that they can meet those very basic needs that that are so important to support themselves but also to support their families I am glad that you know that the work Fair went well thumbs up I think it's it is definitely a model that we're excited about and it is something that I think APS can set themselves up as a standard you know for engaging with the state agency and the and the public services that are available so that we can work with a large employer to do that so I was really happy to hear that

[02:34:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:35:00]
I think we need to take a look at the procedural directives there and maybe just strengthen that a little more maybe go through policy and instruction and take a look at that I think it would be incumbent upon us to take a look at that little closer and stuff and you know I don't have a whole lot I just wanted to say that you know I think the Secretary of here but I think we should put in a work order for her chair it's very and I know the squeaky wheel gets the grease and stuff but I like to submit my work order for her chair if we could just do that and then and then and then we'll get it right on OK Google

[02:36:00]
I think I can give these to the Arcanine to our dog here at APS yeah we can do that yeah thank you so much thank you thank you we were elected to the board some of us so just wanted to point that out it's been a whole year already so and then I just wanted to say also congratulations to our newly promoted police officers and thank you again for always doing my daughter on a first name basis 4 years later they're still asking about her so thanks again for that and then way to go tell would on their Grant as well so very proud of him for that and I look forward to also sharing these cookies from awesome who are probably really pissed off by now got to feed them before I left so

[02:37:00]
and then so proud of our D smart team I to get emotional every time I hear them talk or hear hear stories that they share so you know what what an incredible job that they have and I'm also fully supportive of both of our public comments tonight I loved Jan and Josiah the students who came and spoke and I really appreciated the comprehensive policy analysis that they did on our policy and I really think that we could really benefit from that and you're right there wasn't a lot of changes that we would have to consider but to be able to and the youth have been working on these kind of projects for many years and they also do tobacco awareness in their schools on their own multiple times a year so I'm really proud of them for what they did around that we could all benefit from tobacco education especially at that age and really think they'd be a great partner and I appreciate that the resources that they gave us I appreciate the analysis the comprehensive

[02:38:00]
analysis that they did and actually Senate Bill 25 is being heard today I wanted to ask Dr Escobedo for an update but but send it Bill 25 was a tax increase on cigarettes and tobacco products so I hope to get an update on that to wanted to ask the students about it to I think we you know we have it up every year but and then really encouraged by the special education committee meeting with our APS leadership and really you know the verbal testimonies that we received last time and you're right there's 3031 testimonies that I had written down that along with the written testimonies really do have an impact on us so thank you for sharing both of that and again totally kind of a comprehensive analysis you always bring solutions to the table and we really appreciate that

[02:39:00]
you bring solutions to the table and I fully support the implementation planning and plan that the team will work on so thank you thank you for that and thank you everybody who sat this out thank you I think I'm going to have a gag order that levels against me but thank you so much for bringing up this and I think so that people get the same message and that I mean 366 pages in those of us who have been in the system know that things are not always clear and the different administrators interpret things differently and what I think the sense of what is in here when I read the comments it wasn't people not wanting to work hard

[02:40:00]
it's this frustration with with Superfluous things getting in the way of the real work that needs to be done and so I just I really appreciate the work that started and applaud the fact that there's a process to move forward on and give people things in writing so thank you again I appreciate the fact that is working on a project I know a lot of these things were great but did you just incredible team I personally interacted with him so when

[02:41:00]
principal was killed down in or deed I should say about a heart attack down in Costa Rica down in Mexico some place and then of course man's on the Mesa I went over there when they were there to help with that issue and of course Aztec and then I know they've been dealing with a couple issues today so this is a great team and you know the next time the general or anybody else comes and says you got a story for us I suggest you tell him about this story tell him about what they did at you tell him about what exactly they're doing to follow up and how they used their time over the Christmas vacation for this so go tell him about that let's write that story okay cuz I know I got a story about the fact you know that that our competition we didn't stop that for a little

[02:42:00]
recognition of the Aztec folks but I didn't hear anything about our December or December team going to Aztec and spending all the time so go Dr Peterson so not that I don't like her too so that's fine but anyway so there's more to that story so thank you very much I appreciate that and with that Wednesday February 21st at 5:00 here and then the next place
