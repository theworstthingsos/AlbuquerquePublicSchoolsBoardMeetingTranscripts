I'd like to roll call please here Barbara Peterson

[00:08:00]
Peggy is on the phone she's not feeling too well I think Barbara is going to be on the phone for a little while and she'll be here in a little bit I'd like a doctorate of the February 20th Board of Education meeting agenda please go a second thank you for coming good evening I have an honor of introducing an extraordinary student is quick is the youngest student we know of to complete hands on equations pre-algebra

[00:09:00]
tell him that is approved by APS for elementary gifted students teacher Katie Hamill has been using this curriculum with gifted students for a few years we will not say many as the script is written he expects all her students to complete the initial series of 26 lessons with 100% accuracy by winter break of their fifth grade year she calls the students to achieve this Milestone now get ready she calls them Math Monsters as they each get a monster puppet and make it in a Monster Mash dance some students have to push very hard to make this objective by the winter break goal and some students don't finish by winter break but that's okay

[00:10:00]
because they are able to work toward achieving this goal by the end of their 5th grade year some years a fourth grader will get it done by winter break but that's rare once a third grader finished it and that was Miss Hamilton's son Ben is now a sophomore studying at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia with the Dual degree in science and engineering this fall Miss Hamilton started working with a second grader Miss Evelyn quick Evelyn started zooming through the Hands-On Equations she just loved it when Miss Quick was told about she was determined to beat his record and be the youngest student to become a math monster this curriculum involved setting up simplifying and solving equations using one or two related unknown variables and using all four

[00:11:00]
operations in second grade Evelyn really had not been exposed to much multiplication and division and didn't know her multiplication tables by heart she pushed her way through all 26 lessons Computing the multiplication and division through Force by winter break it was an exercise in determination and stamina When Miss Quick broke Ben's record by becoming the youngest student ever to become a math monster Miss Hamilton quickly and asked him to see if he could come and visit over winter break to officially succeed his title he came and brought a letter from a professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia congratulating Miss Quick and inviting her to apply when she's

[00:12:00]

[00:39:00]
list of specific items to be discussed or acted on it meetings and due to these rules public forum is not a dialogue with the board members public forum is an opportunity for the Board of Education to listen to you and hear your comments tonight there are two speakers so to accommodate the two speakers each speaker has 2 minutes 2 minutes for comments within the public forum time the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you at the end of the given time please complete your sentence quickly so that other speakers will have a chance to speak you may not yield your unused time to another speaker and you are always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you are unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak with in the 45 minutes the Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn it's only at this time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each

[00:40:00]
so our first speaker is Edgar Briggs hopefully I said that correctly good evening superintendent board president some time ago that I stood in front of you with some of the other people to appear continuation of Middle School sports which I want to thank you for that I'm not sure how often do you think for things Middle School sports has been a very important component as they pass Middle School principal tonight and APS employees one which is Julianna Reid Julianne herself as a special supporter a spirit of students Community were 20 years ago when she was part of the group from Grant Middle School and others in the community to open the first community center community school at Middlebury Connecticut

[00:41:00]
what is Paul broom Breadwinners on Armijo Mic Mac and Cheese and numerous members of the staff at Grant one was Julianne Reed to make this idea become a reality is a grant result in a true ownership and units in the community increase voting to support the district we'd watch our tabulations and he would increase continually because our community was using the school as a community center that was funded by the city and a collaboration reduce increase volume increase

[00:42:00]
go to the growth community schools homework diners to go across the district has been a component very impressive and two or three of those now in the homework diners as a part-time title one person myself to this I close by once again since graduation to Juliana and other for for individuals the three individuals and I just recognized tonight the spirit makes the school special without those people I was my honor to have you on my staff as a principal and she was always there with all the ease and Excedrin is vital people but also like to offer it to myself as a volunteer to communication and the first things first I want to apologize

[00:43:00]
I sincerely am sorry for my behavior but I think you need to understand why I do understand why you react the way you do the demeaning comments the the silence the way you dismiss me I've Seen It All Before and in part it is my fault at as a Native American man who is 6 ft 4 I don't really have the luxury of being angry I cannot be upset as soon as I do I view it as a danger or as an intelligent do you understand that all of this is from place of frustration and pain when you say things like the staff has a full-time job and can't spend all their time answering your questions and continual discourse with this as to me is that you assume that I do not have a full-time job and therefore I'm not allowed to speak and that I do not deserve to be here and that hurts me it reminds me of every time that a teacher's ever told me that I will never succeed it reminds me of whenever I sit in my little brother's IEP and

[00:44:00]
add salt is intelligence because he has Down syndrome it reminds me of that little girl who could not learn math because her teacher did not have the resources nor the training to do so it it hurts a lot to deal with this I beg of you to remember why I am here I am here because the student was assaulted at your schools I'm here to help you guys I'm here to be on your side and to actually influence change when you just miss me you dismiss my little brother you dismiss the assaulted students you dismiss my people please just once as a Native American I would like to be treated as equal thank you for your input that concludes the public forum OK Google

[00:45:00]
APS is setting the standard for accessibility we recently received Kudos from our accessibility auditor a company by the name of sight improve they were very impressed by the quality assurance scores across the entire District the site improve representative stated that for most large districts like APS he usually see sees quality assurance scores in the low to the 60's APS has quality assurance scores averaging in the Middle East quality assurance scores reflect readability scores optimized images the number of broken links and the number of misspellings that can be found on a website quality assurance reports are sent out to all APS department webmasters on a weekly basis and all School

[00:46:00]
webmasters on a monthly basis much of the credit goes to our webmasters for reading the reports and spending the time fixing the errors on their sites so that they are truly accessible web accessibility is one of the web team's top priorities we are very proud of all of our schools and Department of Masters to be setting the standards for web accessibility in education lot of hard work and it's really wonderful to see that that we're headed in the right direction so as you learned in our last Board of Education meeting the district has introduced a new monthly podcast hosted by a retired APS teacher gifted in the art of conversation the feedback we've received so far about APS open

[00:47:00]
book about the aps open book podcast with Marc goodrem has a generated very positive feedback from the media and the public alike I had the opportunity earlier today to visit with Mark in preparation of the upcoming March podcast episode if you haven't listened to the February podcast yet I wholeheartedly encourage you to do so the format is refreshing there's time to answer questions with the satisfaction that little editing if any at all is done so you can really explain and discuss issues without fear that the most important points will be edited out we talked about the quality of teaching in our classrooms today and the biggest misconception about the district and our hopes and so much more the aps open podcast is another service that we hope parents students

[00:48:00]
what's in Staffing anyone interested in APS will take advantage of in order to independently learn about the state's largest school district I'm a specially delighted to know that anyone anywhere anytime has access to the podcast at no cost APS is one of the first urban school districts in America in the United States to launch a district podcast and I'm confident that we'll have more to talk about as time goes by this concludes oh I have one more thing I'm sorry and finally I'd like to give a shout out to La Cueva high school camera Orchestra was accepted to National Orchestra to the National Orchestra Festival as part of the American String Teachers Association National Conference they are the only New Mexico public high school that has ever been

[00:49:00]
accepted for this National Honor that's so wonderful way to go La Cueva very proud of you this concludes the superintendent's report thank you so much is the music guy I appreciate very much and they will be performing I think in March here at that conference and so I look forward to actually hearing them so thank you very much the first one is consideration for approval of design development for Janet Collins school for integrated arts Kate phase two that's a discussion actually yes thank you very much I hope answered the question about

[00:50:00]
the additional money that would be paid to the architect at the completion of the design development phase which is what the presentation was at Capital outlay so you'll see that the total architectural contract was 1,275,276.68 and we encumbered 891,000,938.55 so when you see on the budget analysis it talks about a million dollars in that activity that's where we encumbered the 891,000 and the amount paid today is $280,000 and an additional $11 will be paid at the completion of the DD booklet and I stand for questions are there any questions I think that was what we asked is

[00:51:00]
exactly what we're going to vote on and what we're voting on basically is the completion of the design document and payment for our contractors of that amount of money that we instead of the whole million dollars that was there at the amount of money that they've spent so far because we cannot go on to the approval of the follow-on until we get that started out so it's not understood by the word and is there any questions any questions from the from the phone do I have any questions from the phone any other discussion OK Google

[00:52:00]
what school district number 12 and the communication workers of America and APS food services at presenter will be Torgerson Chief Human Resources illegal Support Services in Karen rudess Jackie Director of Human Resources president Piercy board members superintendent Reedy we are here tonight to seek ratification for the tentative agreement that CWA and Food Services has agreed to and I'd like to introduce Paul Aguilar good evening Mr presidents are

[00:53:00]
any questions are you going to present anything or you you have the tentative agreement any questions from board members I'll go to the phone first Peggy or Barbara any questions I can't hear very well

[00:54:00]
it is a little bit less it's kind of about the age of my oldest son not quiet but okay I got a motion for food I did have just a couple questions I know on on your page 366

[00:55:00]
any question over here and I think it's more a question of language 17624

[00:56:00]
and and I think the issue there is even though it said it would be done safely in other words it's not just automatically done and said if the bus driver says they don't want to do the route but it's agreed that it could be done safely president Dr Percy board members that I thought we were out of asking for ratification on the Food Service right now okay so that's probably the next one then I'm sorry I was trying to figure out

[00:57:00]
at the employees request and so that there then able to go back to their former position at the same salary I got the opinion of what it was going to be I just I guess I wouldn't you I'm not supposed to OK Google that's not in the contract language

[00:58:00]
but so that would be dependent on several variables in each contract has different language but per FMLA of course we have to follow those guidelines and then some contracts have extended unpaid medical leave or just extended unpaid personally we actually try and work with the employees as much as possible to retain their jobs if they returned from an HR leave standpoint but there's nothing I did notice that I know the other contractors for the most part it depends on if it's 3:00 management and we're working through FMLA and an 88 accommodation but we give the employee all the advantages they have until they wish to go out on disability because you don't have that in writing if the employee

[00:59:00]
keep taking it you would take the the information from an employee permanent employees doctor right if you have to seek The Physician statement and Mr Turkish and can speak more to that I just wondered about that good evening period

[01:00:00]
12.1 in uniforms and you had a little red line at the very end says each employee shall receive four shirts Emily annually is that the only part of the uniform you get for sure I just kind of thought it would be like for it uniforms or something you know previously we gave it to them without contract but we are providing three and then they asked for 4:00 so we put it in contract language to give him four instead of three which we were previously

[01:01:00]
are you doing already what do they do for the rest of the uniforms normally the Friday is a spirit day so they'll the kitchens will wear the spirits or the union shirts that they have but I mean do we give it we provide these uniforms for them you know they don't have to buy them themselves correct the pants snow in the professional wear so khakis black pants dark pants are there any other special things that they have like safety apparel or things like that because you know I'm just I just funny to me that you all of a sudden said okay you get for sure you know know we provide when there are other kinds of things that they get right aprons everything

[01:02:00]
the kitchens would actually utilize for safety purposes that that's just part of the job in the sense of where they are right now to the job or whatever yeah we provide for safety and for health regulations why not 5:00 in the kitchen

[01:03:00]
the names of employees in a bargaining unit and a unique identifier and you have a unique identifier indicated twice oh thank you I know I never catch those kinds of things so it's kind of proud of myself thank you very much is the consideration for the negotiated agreement between educational

[01:04:00]
verification to request ratification on the CW the EA now bus driver bus attendant tentative agreement and Cathy Chavez from the union is here to present as well as Paul Aguilar good evening thank you for having us here tonight I just want to say that for our contract this year you know I've been around since dirt was discovered but this has to be the year that I personally am so very proud of our newest group that is now part of aea and that's our bus drivers in attendance I want to thank the board for all of our many discussions in order to help us support and get them in there I want to thank Royce and Nick from the bus okay I'm going to say I'm sorry I'm old I used to be a bus driver and we called it the bus barn

[01:05:00]
that was a long time ago as management I can tell you that we had very positive negotiations it was really an honor and a privilege to be a part of it I really didn't have a whole lot to do with anything because they had a fan not only on management side but our leadership side we had fantastic people I sat there and learned a lot and just interfered when I thought it was necessary so I want to say thank you and I'm looking forward to many many more years together working with them at this time I bored I would like to introduce to you two people Florentina Lopez and Robin on the leadership role and they want to introduce their bargaining team and just say a few words to the board as this is their first contract and they would just like to have a couple of words to say so would you just to have them do that please okay

[01:06:00]
good evening president members of the board my name is Florentina Lopez I am a school bus driver I work with the aps Transportation I've been doing school bus driving for 35 years already so coming to APS is a really big step for us having to do the agreement between bus drivers and attendance to work with Royce and Nick and stuff like that and negotiations restaurant

[01:07:00]
Mr President and members of the board my name is Ruben Apodaca and I'm a bus driver with APS I'm also a member of the contract gratification to negotiation team the other members of the team if you could stand up Anita Joe is an attendant Richard Valenzuela is a driver and other members couldn't make it tonight but they were all part of the team and we put in a lot of hours it was a learning experience it was a positive learning experience and I think one of the best things to come out of it besides an agreement is that we have a positive relationship with our managers we feel that we can go to them at any time to discuss any problems and get a beneficial resolution to any problem or issue that we come up with so thank you for your time and your support I'd like to also bring Roy been

[01:08:00]
add Nicholas Brooke to the podium so that they can speak as well cuz they were an integral part to this and we all learned a lot about negotiations with bus drivers

[01:09:00]
I can barely hear you I'm not sure what the deal is is this Barbara or Peggy okay thank you period

[01:10:00]
play thank you I think I think they're saying good job board president because excuse me because it is a it is a new contract for the bus drivers but we are together I also want to thank you for the Albuquerque educational assistance part of the contract thank you to Karen you know we again we had our issues but we resolved them I think we got some really good language in there but I'd like to introduce the team that worked with us very closely and that is out of assistant I have Merle Tillman she is a long-standing educational assistance out of Michigan Elementary

[01:11:00]
Alameda Elementary School and my newest staff member Brenda fire wherever she is she's learning and also Debbie Conrad staff and we just this was a good year I really appreciate it was it just went so well and I mean we've got a lot more we want because I'm very greedy but when we will continue to ask for those things the only thing I want to repeat that I repeated every year is we really need more professional development especially in the special ed Arena we only have NBCI some autism and that's little to none and the kids that we are getting are coming more and more challenging and not just in special ed and this is not just in the schoolhouse but on the school buses so the more understanding and

[01:12:00]
I mean we can get on how to help and work with these kids and how to protect ourselves because they are becoming more and more physically violent we just want some more opportunity to train we now have the 5 days prior to school starting we have negotiated three of those days hopefully to be professional development and we're going to work on what those are going to look like so that's a big plus but but that's the one thing that I asked and and with all due respect and nothing we have some fabulous excellent principals out there but there are some that still don't understand or are not as supportive as they should be so hopefully somewhere in your realm you can help us work with that because there are some serious issues out there that we can work on and so that I do thank you Lord and we hope that you do rat

[01:13:00]
thank you very much I appreciate this comments discussions any comments on some of the content or at all I just I just wanted to thank the team the fact that these folks work together is is amazing but looking at this information it is very complicated and I learned an awful lot I'm not sure what questions to ask but it's very complicated and I appreciate the work and thank you so much appreciate all that you do as well thank you to both you know the bus drivers and also to the educational assistance your backbone for our schools because you tend to be some of the first eyes for our kids and it's the first line of safety for a lot of kids and the importance of what you see and how you engage with students is really critical my mother was a 25-year Rhett

[01:14:00]
play with APS and was an educational assistant the entire time and she still talks about you know that work and how lovely it was she never left our community she was always in the South Valley but she saw the work increasingly get more and more difficult as the years went by so I just just want to say a note of gratitude for the amount of work you do and a note well taken in terms of that professional development because I think it goes without saying that we really need that backbone to be strong because you see students sometimes when no other eyes are on the students especially when they're on the bus so thank you very much for your hard work yes go ahead hey Google

[01:15:00]
the negotiating team feels like there is sufficient language is a contract to deal with the professional development part and my the other part of my question because I do hear instances of EA being injured on the job do we have a way of collecting that information looking at it in order to really figure out what do we need to work on what do we need to do something professional development language about the fragility of the job in terms of the violence

[01:16:00]
I'm getting injured and are the things that we need to work on in terms of that agreement or in terms of how we can it's not much agreement is just what we do in terms of real processes and you know make sure that we we do provide those protections so with that do you have any thoughts board member Peterson from the balcony and Dr Piercy yes we have embedded some new contract language in that regard the assault language for EA has always been present and we track that and they have to file a report with the police and so we are in the mode of tracking that and they are going up and they're going up not just in Special Ed but particularly in regular at so that is something we're tracking and we also agreed that we would have the non-violent Crisis Intervention training for some of the harder to feel special like classrooms prior to them being placed in the classroom so when their new higher they have to have that training completed before they move into the classroom and then

[01:17:00]
and the other thing that we would like to do too is with those extra days at the beginning of the year we have 2000 years across the district roughly we would like to have all of that PD prior to the school year it's just a lot to do in one setting because we have so many for like you're trying to train all the teachers at once but we're part of our orientation is going to focus on that and we are going to work on that piece okay thank you yeah I think one of the things I might request you have something I do real quick to evaluate all of the EA positions to look at all the functional capacity of their course to help protect them in their positions yeah I think of course first thing is to understand what our problem is

[01:18:00]
I mean from the point of view of the Avengers and that kind of thing but the bigger problem is to actually address what are the causes of that and how to react to start preventing those kinds of things from happening so I think again from a board perspective you asked for what's our realm well I don't know what our realm is anymore to some extent but but I think again it's a matter of saying if we could get that information and then discuss some of the issues related to how do I address what we call the root causes of those what are the root causes and some of them may be like situations those kind of things but but again part of its working with our community hospital understand that we we have to be able to provide a safe place but we also have to try to work with our parents and with our community members to in fact see if we can have methods and techniques that they might be able to use to help with

[01:19:00]
but there's still so much that needs to be done and you're absolutely right special ed is a world by itself and we know that we have a lot of serious issues there as far as violence etc etc but what we're finding more and more is our regular kids especially the babies are coming in extremely extremely and I am not exaggerating emotionally and mentally Disturbed and they are Runners they are attackers they are biters they are kickers and are regular special because they love

[01:20:00]
they understand the work they do we need some kind of supports in the Regular Ad now we need it all around but I attended a conference of the Americas for the mayors of South America the Albuquerque Police Department did a presentation the presentation they did was exactly about what we're talking about 10 they said it started about 10 years ago when the recession really hit they showed the high crime areas or the high poverty areas and what they showed was the research was showing that all the babies who would be kinder Age first grade now are coming in as a result of the the bad stuff that happened people with no jobs no ability to feed their children turning to drugs and alcohol physical and mental abuse in the homes and these kids are coming in as

[01:21:00]
result it's kind of like the fetal alcohol syndrome was 100 years ago these kids are now coming in with that but they're coming into regular Ed because they're not being diagnosed as special as yet the SAT the the the the the the amount of time to get them into where they really belong take so long but in between that those of us that take care of them need the training on how to understand to work with him and to protect ourselves and to protect them and the support that go with that and I think part of that part of the Pre-K or a childhood the kind of things that some of our board members have actually worked with him at a health services in that that needs to be part of the solution as well so that we can actually work with those agencies with the type of things that are going on to try to help some of the preventive things from from getting to the later stages so yeah it's a big Community issue

[01:22:00]
not just us but it's a big Community issue and so I I welcome that recognition and I welcome the ability for us to work on that so we will definitely be doing that yeah just a couple of things actually I did read all this which is really dangerous it's really dangerous so let me just ask a couple questions and I'm sure that this is everything's fine I just you know when I when I read words for longevity and they're talking about the employees base hourly rate and they said that he is including Haws will receive one 300.00 years of service and this is added to says the employees base hourly pay rate I don't know that that's the right

[01:23:00]
language from what does that sound if you got an hourly rate and it's like 1 2. 0 0 5

[01:24:00]
difference between definitely tax rate and tax property tax but that didn't wasn't clear to people sometimes there's a difference between the rate and the actual base so maybe can clarify that or and that's on the next page as well you know that those things just to make sure that that's clear not that you wouldn't love to have on the base rate hourly rate that would be good and now now just a couple little editorials there this is the article 14 but over there all in the way of eye and this is where you're talking about routes where you might actually be able to be done safely or not done safely or certain things stopping and and so the bus drivers may have a disagreement about whether that you know stopping or whatever they're doing is going to be safe or not

[01:25:00]
and so the idea was you negotiate that little and you determined from all the bus drivers whether they think that's safe or not and and so the sentence was it says if the driver is still refuses to do the route it will be posted in the driver will move move to standby but I think you mean if the driver is still refuses to do the route even though it's determined to be safe no there's not just just because you didn't want to do it I'm pretty sure that's clear is that what you intend there I just kind of wanted to make sure it's clear that it's only if in fact it's already been determined through whatever process you have here that it is going to be a safe thing but if the driver is still refuses to do it then they would move off to do something else page 102.007 of 6212

[01:26:00]
I don't want you to think that that's the only thing this is for example you just say for example Balloon Fiesta yeah I'm really getting it here on page 104.009 or 62 under D this is the drug testing and it says during during the employees normal work schedule and employee employee Shelby compensated at them

[01:27:00]
play regular hourly rate if not the employee shall be compensated at the miscellaneous rate I'm saying well wait a minute it says you shall be compensated employees regular hourly rate that's that sounds like a child to me I don't even know what this miscellaneous rate means and I don't know why you would do that if you said it shall be compensated at the regulatory system for different special

[01:28:00]
events sometimes it's higher it just sounded funny cuz you said you shall be says if not I don't know maybe if not so what you mean is that if it's if it's not during a time you would be compensated at the missiles rate so maybe you could just say if it's not during a regular Transportation time you would be compensated at the miscellaneous rate just to make sure it's clear that just sounded like we're not going to pay you so

[01:29:00]
it's not like you don't have some Troublesome activities going on in the bus and you're trying to drive this bus right and you got a bunch of crap going on you know sorry but you know it's it's exactly the problem so but down here to keep a current seating chart for each of their schools on their bus at all times I don't know what that means seating charts

[01:30:00]
so they might not have the names of those students the first day of school so that was all part of that discussion it was interesting I was surprised too back in the day when I rode the bus to the list of all the names I'd be impressed yeah and and I'm very much in favor of the the kindergarten students

[01:31:00]
like I'm almost to the point of saying I wouldn't want any of them to be left on 10th and I coach soccer for a lot of times in my rule was when we're done playing when we're done with soccer I want you to be there to pick up your kid and if you're not there to pick up your kid I'm taking him home and you can come pick him up at my house cuz I'm not leaving him there and we're talking about you know older kids than kindergarten kids yeah well that's all I have I just you know and I felt like it was important for me to actually read this this time in particular you know I've read the other one

[01:32:00]
before and I look for changes and I said okay I think I'm okay but this is a new one this is something that I said you know it's my responsibility to some extent to see if I can actually force myself to read all this stuff and then I'm surprised you got a seating chart I would never know that if I hadn't read it you know yes it is really important and whatever we can do you know to help make that process better and I know it's hard

[01:33:00]
do you know you going to your kids not there a kid is there and make sure I wait a few minutes or not you know and in particular first of the year you know when kids maybe don't know exactly when they're getting on the bus when they're getting off the bus you know that kind of a thing so you guys are a big interface for us you know that first coming to school today leaving school at the end of the day making sure they get home to their to their families big deal big deal and so I really appreciate that so thank you very much that's all I have are there any other comments I want to just say that the EA

[01:34:00]
it does concern me these incidents is that they're describing and I think we have to figure out a way to do something and ask the superintendent perhaps there may be some way either through our auditing process or process of looking at incidents I don't know how we do that but somehow raise it to the board level so that we can at least be aware of it and try to do something about it when there are incidents with children it just doesn't make sense to expect that you have to handle it on a day-by-day basis if it continues or x amount of time and you have to decide what is reasonable there and I would only in Florida the negotiators to please let's see what we can do to get behind our stuff in a way I don't think that you're not behind them but I do think that it's easy to feel isolated and not thought about when you have to handle that kind of stuff on a daily basis

[01:35:00]
so I'm hoping if there's some way we can work this in to see him where the incidences are happening and then figure out how we connect this to our community schools or whomever there's got to be some way to to try to do something more proactively rather than having an incident and then it's all over the newspaper or the news or whatever thank you thank you babe I think that's that's okay so we have a motion in front of us and that's with maybe a few of the little minor Corrections okay thank you very much but go over to our last mile considerations

[01:36:00]
thank you for coming guys appreciate it thank you thank you thank you period action plan in the area of special education services from June through November we had reviewed each IEP and found that many of the issues identified in may have not been corrected at that time we reviewed the options available to the board in such a circumstance and we did recommend revocation based on the cumulative monthly monitoring visits we bring you this evening and action item to deliver the formal notice of intent

[01:37:00]
provoke the charter of La Solano Leadership Academy the draft of the notice is in your packet and that draft describes the legal basis for the potential revocation it identifies the date and process for a revocation hearing which will be on Wednesday March 20th at the regular Board of Education meeting the notice establishes a March 8th deadline for the school and APS to Present written materials and all evidence to be used in the hearing and the notice establishes that they hearing will be conducted by the aps Board of Education upon your approval this evening our office will deliver the notice of intent to revoke while we're on a Leadership Academy in accordance within the required 15 days of the vote and if you have any questions we are happy to answer them we also have Mr Melinda's here to help with any questions on the legal side

[01:38:00]
okay so so what we're voting on is basically to send the revocation notice to LA resolana to be followed up with the actual hearing to it should be on the 20th which is regular board meeting we would have a special section of that like a special issue that would have this outline of that you seen on the second page here which says there will be a public comment specific to that to that issue a presentation by the aps presentation board and then questions from our board members and then a vote so that's kind of how that would work so are there any questions about that any comments so it will be the board that will hear the river

[01:39:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:40:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:41:00]
up through president Piercy on board member Montoya Cordova actually we did another follow-up visit in January and into early February we are giving the school absolutely every opportunity to demonstrate significant progress so it won't it won't be just based on the November vacation to have a second thank you I will go on to our house

[01:42:00]
passed out of House Appropriations on Monday today Wednesday and so we're looking really at the far right column of your packet and we're looking at the document that says update to the aps Board of Education government Affairs its color coded as well okay so what we have here is we're showing you last year's operating budget and then all the way on the right hand side is the budget that actually passed out of House Appropriations and will be on the floor of the House of Representatives at the end of We Believe

[01:43:00]
sometime this week or Sunday or Monday so the at-risk index is where 113 million is being placed and so that increases the at-risk index from 0.13 to 0.25 in the funding formula and then there's about 7 million dollars to increase the bilingual and Multicultural education program factor and then they're taking a 6 million dollar credit by capping the age of students at 22 and moving that money to higher education and then there's a 14 million dollar savings for the small school size adjustment and that's a three-year reduction in that rule schools will also get an additional factor in their funding that at 8 million dollars and then there's this 62.5 million dollars that has been funded

[01:44:00]
for us to move towards 190 days funding after school programs and then 80 hours of professional development and so we really have to be cautious of how the language is rolled out and how we're implementing that and that'll be part of the process through Miss Coleman's office is actually moving into the formula and that is at 11:10 million dollars so if you go to page 2 their funding and increase to Erb at 0.5% which is 8.5 million and then the major won the major sections there that you should be paying attention to is our salary increases so they're providing a very minimal amount to set a 10-dollar per hour minimum wage for all educational related employees there is a there's a bill that

[01:45:00]
House Bill 397 that would require school districts to have a 12.00 minimum an hour salary and that's in House Appropriations but they did not fund that so they only funded to bring everyone up to $10 which of course you see there is very minimal so what they're recommending for teacher for teachers first if we could go there is there recommending and their funding at 38 million dollars minimum tears of 41,000 for level one 50,000 for level 2 and 60,000 for level three and then principal minimum salary have to be at 60,000 that's the minimum and then their funding additional raises which you can see for teachers principals

[01:46:00]
another staff there all at 6% so the budget language is very clear and what they're wanting you to do is come up to the minimums so come up to the 50 and then do 6% is how the the language and the budget bill is worded at this time unfortunately Transportation you see them not being funded to what they need to be the Pre-K kindergarten has received additional money and then there's additional money for instructional materials you know there's about there's 57 million dollars for instructional materials but the bill that would allow for some flexibility is having some trouble so turn that over to president piercing members of the board superintendent reading from the last presentation that shows you that priority bills that we are

[01:47:00]
talking and based on your input we added in some more color coding to kind to show the movement through the legislation or legislature and where we see those things moving the house bill 45 that Dr Escobedo just referenced was Sherwin-Williams stapleton's instructional material bill that passed two house committees in the house floor and then failed in Senate committee last week and it failed their because of the attempts to eliminate private schools was not well received so the problem with the failure of that bill is it was also making it possible so that we would have more flexibility to spend instructional materials and not be bound to the 50% only 50% of the funds being spent on Pedro approved list books so that those currently stand

[01:48:00]
any more follow up I have a question on the attendance

[01:49:00]
the amendment that they were still working on the committee the conversation was removing the penalty for students to not lose a driver's license based on attendance so it's still alive and still moving but there's I'm not sure exactly where that one is right now so that the amendment to remove the driver's license which is so punitive I mean I don't know why we would do this part is being removed but we haven't heard it again on a committee yet thank you very much that the lowest paid employees are looking at the same percentage of salary increase

[01:50:00]
allocated but it would sure be nice to not have that be a fight within our budget for a change so that's one thing I'm still even though I know it's better I still have concerns about Senate Bill 2:45 and then Charter Schools access to facilities I know it's been substituted that I think it's one that we need to keep an eye on I think there's some really exciting ones coming through for ethnic studies and some support for the number of teachers and all that is the University's prepared for this is are we looking at how many

[01:51:00]
teachers are coming in and being hired from other places in the country and just the whole issue of the teacher shortage and I mean the momentum is also positive and at the same time the reality of implementation and making sure that both teacher voices in educator voices for what goes on in the schools and and District voices for what the reality is of how how it takes time to implement especially when it comes down to credentialing of of teachers that have to be I mean I think there has to be really strong and clear goal posts I mean it's just it's not going to happen overnight so hopefully there's the way of making sure that the urgency is felt

[01:52:00]
and at the same time it's within the realm of what are the universities prepared to take on how do we how do we do the professional development so that it respects what teachers are doing making sure that I'm going back to the materials making sure that the instructional materials that the staff has access to reflects our community and is part of what is being implemented for ethnic studies I'm having come from the nmsba board of directors meeting the impact Aid and I know I picked brains and really struggled with understanding it and I

[01:53:00]
we appreciate the time that you all have taken in helping me understand it and it's a real dilemma because I think there is a real moral imperative to make sure that the districts that are impacted and that's especially Zuni in Gallup McKinley making sure that they have access to that money and so I appreciate the approach of saying we can't have losers and if we can just keep that in the Forefront of how do we how do we come up with the money so that we don't damage what happens to children in Albuquerque and at the same time do it right for for the communities a big conversation in the last few weeks I think that it will probably resurfaced and did his a question of

[01:54:00]
how to decide who gets funding and how we allocate resources and I mean I don't see any way that it's not going to be influenced and impacted by the Yahtzee decision because it's I mean it just seems like when we look at sufficient funding so somehow figuring out how do we be the voice that our community in Albuquerque needs how do we continue to advocate for making sure that and I do appreciate the fact that I think you all are thinking along that line period

[01:55:00]
play conversation to figure out there's a lot of nuances and I'm sure we'll continue to see it evolve in it is a hard decision when you know the whole state is trying to come together to figure out how to allocate resources across many very different districts with different needs and we have at-risk students you know all over in every district and Yazzie Martinez was a lawsuit to represent 11 districts but it's a story of the whole state and so we have to keep that in mind when we look at legislation too it's definitely a part of my community community

[01:56:00]
Mr Melendez take this because it's a 472 page Amendment to the election law from last year I think the question is does it really fix HB 98 Mr President deficiencies that were left in 98 so so follow up with whatever election in November does it get on the road for the following year if the if the bill passes I tried to find out where exactly it was in that bill that

[01:57:00]
I actually figure it out and it was hard to figure it out that it really it's I don't I didn't come prepared with these specific section I can get that to you but it's in the section which says that if you have an election in November and it passes there will be a dual bill sent to prepared to be sent to the taxpayer and they will be giving an additional 10 days in which to get the bill prepared if it passes if it doesn't pass the bill would go out as no tax increase I'll find that section for you it's got some parallel language to track the tax code to figure out from that language in there exactly how that related to our sb99

[01:58:00]
PlayStation and I didn't go back and look at USB 9 and 833 to see what the language was cuz I probably could have paralleled I will I will track after that there's a specific section that I did see sections in there but I wasn't sure which I well I could have probably guessed but there's specific language that deals with the dates for imposing the tax for sb9 and House Bill 33 and it removes the barrier that is in the existing laws and I'll track after those there okay that's good if a school board wants to hold an election on a date other than the November regular election

[01:59:00]
that would be described in the laws a special election it will be a male ballot in male ballot election yes so the goal is to encourage school districts to hold their elections in November of odd numbered years in going forward and that would apply only

[02:00:00]
we had a discussion last week in reference to the medical marijuana in schools which would obviously impact updating policy has that moved since we last spoke about it president Persie by remember I mean yes it did pass Senate Judiciary does that work so that medical cannabis in schools has passed two committees and I believe is heading to the center of Florida so there are at least two other bills that are about medical marijuana that have like two or three line references to school students and their ability to use them like the one the first one we talked about I think 204 Senate Bill 2004 there is so that when schools can demonstrate that they are risk of losing Federal

[02:01:00]
I mean there's an opt-out and it was amended before it was amended on the senate floor or in judiciary San Andreas Judiciary it was amended there that that decision would be done by the PED secretary rather than local school districts which I think is a favorable Amendment for us so that that's the person who holds the accountability for that decision rather than school districts and what about the age we talked about that last week President Pierce remember which is not a quite companion solution to that but an effort to offer diplomas to adult basic kids through ped is also moving

[02:02:00]
floor so that's going to go back into the house but they're seeing as you saw from Dr escobedo's budget report there seems to be pretty consistent support for age 22 being the limit and that being pulled out of sag funding I think that's disappointing can I follow up on that is there any chance that they do like a 1 year old so that they'd be time to establish other programs President Pierce said I do believe there's a house Memorial that's being proposed Friday and how sad committee with representative Garrett as one of the co-sponsors to study that I'm not sure if that'll have immediate impact or or what the decision I haven't seen anything that is doing that specifically a proposing that for legislation but that is a conversation that's relevant

[02:03:00]
there is the grandfathering in of existing students and so they see the most legislators seem to feel like that's enough to kind of give us time to study because they are the current students will be grandfathered in seems like seems like we need to start having real conversations with CNN and figuring out how how we can make appropriate programs and maybe somehow anyway I'm not sure how but it seems like we need to figure that out I think you're going to

[02:04:00]
kill Gordon Bernal and if they don't have a solution just saying oh we'll give 6 million dollars to the higher ed that's no program at all and that's not a program for a higher ed unless they have a program specifically that they require that coordinates directly with Gordon Bernell for example they're going to lose Gordon Bennett and that's really a bad idea and they're going to have a lot of people up there from Gordon Burnell I know talking about this so they better better have their act together because I don't think they have a solution to this I think they're just saying well it should be 22 little be adults or something that'll work his way out know that's not true so I think we need to be more than just a little bit vocal about that because Gordon is our Charter we need to be vocal about it and saying no unless you guys got a solution to this and then Memorial is not a solution Memorial

[02:05:00]
that's not a solution so I'm I'm very much not happy about the fact that have this age limit without any solution to the Gordon Bernal or even RFK for example RFK has quite a few students that are older they're not going to get funding for these kids you know we talk all the time about you know we got to do something about the jails in juvenile it's got to be a better better discussion about that they're supposed to hear this on Friday we're going to be up there Friday so I think we need to make a little bit more of a statement about this then maybe maybe not understand this is a big deal Gordon brunellos had a whole lot of people get to the promise over 500 people got deployments

[02:06:00]
see those kids I'm sorry kids you know who are 33 and have a third grade education basically when they start out with this kind of stuff you know there's not enough piece of legislation and it's really a slight of hand on the part of the legislature in my opinion it's irresponsible and whatever comma mechanism so unless they have some mechanism to fund through the higher education

[02:07:00]
the same exact kind of program and if they don't put that in a bill and make it statutory so that we know that's how it's going to work and they're not making a solution to this President piercing members of the board weed agree and we have been doing what we can do to carry that both the message and the passion that you guys feel for that issue to the legislature is both standing up in committees when we talked about one we've also been talking to them individually tomorrow since you'll be up in the legislature you have appointments set up with three people to of them three of them are sponsors of of sb1 and hb5 we have indicated to those three people that we imagine that will be a topic you want to talk about most of those bills are wonderful I mean the problem

[02:08:00]
really really need to have and then they expect us to go ahead and you know prove the bill even though we don't like that particular thing you know I want that part you know I guess that's what I said when they're describing that bill have they talked about the locations or where I mean is that included that 6 million like I mean it's it's money that's coming out of the scg right and they're they're taking it out of the scg and turning it over to higher ed so it's based on a number of students is what it sounds like right I mean because it's formula base president a lot of the physical impact reports around this issue talk

[02:09:00]
mostly about it being a cost-saving measure that that when they look at the statistics of the percentage of students who finish adult basic education programs that get diplomas it's and they compare the ones in scg funding versus the one in funding at the time they said we can get essentially the same results with about you know 15% of the cost I don't know if a lot of the fiscal impact reports you know identify Gordon Bernal but I know that that's a school that was kind of highlighted at least in Leslie interim committees as being a school that maybe should not be using sdg funding because of the the age of the students so I know that they were maybe aware of that it was going to impact that school but I'm not sure that the legislators really considered that the students in that school are not going to be able to effectively use the alternative option and and higher ed and so they're

[02:10:00]
I feel like there is some now back paddling a little bit to study I've heard them say we're looking into what MDC is supposed to do or what who's supposed to service them and you know what kind of mental social supports we can provide because that's the points we've made when asked is that these students should be served through the SAG even though they're adults it's appropriate because they need the types of wraparound Services more than just basic higher ed programs would provide and have tried to point them out as an exception so I I do feel like they're looking and setting but I'm not sure it was probably without his bringing this up it might have been you know kind of collateral damage of unintended policy potentially is there anything else and just you know just out of the experience out of our agency you know it's Department of Workforce Solutions because we work with all the adult ed basic I mean all the programs are it's part of the Continuum so

[02:11:00]
I can see how quiet can be a difficult conversation because at the same time there is some Merit to a lot of the programs that they do do they do them well for those that are going to adult basic add because there is some value to their programs so I can see why that puts us kind of in a weird spot it's not that higher ed doesn't do a good job I think the question is here is that the money that's going to these schools based on the Seagate a lot of operational costs for them president that I think I'm kind of complicated this conversation is there are some school districts who have provided information to legislators that favor the idea of an age cut off because of their smaller districts they don't have the kind of programs or resources that APS has to put those students in you know different settings or different programs and so

[02:12:00]
Facebook situations where you know what older student is sitting alongside younger students and it's causing some issues in those schools and districts and so I think the initial idea behind the age 22 was just a set of policy so that you know that K12 educational settings would you know be K-12 students and they wouldn't have to turn away or they would have an ability to turn away people who aren't in that age grouping so I can see that perspective as well and there are a lot of programs that have or a lot of those programs sit within adult service programs where they have a braided kind of funding that supports those other things that were talking about like the wraparound services and the peace and Adult Ed is just part of it I mean it's so I Catholic Charities

[02:13:00]
this has a number of services ydi has a number of services there's other things that are blended into a CNM is truly just an adult ed program and you go there and it's not going to be like a Gordon Burnell but you have other you know parts of the state where you see an adult ed program where it is part of a myriad of services that an individual would get I know out of the TANF program uses Adult Ed as well a lot and they rely on those types of providers that put together you know a system of services but they're they're using funding from a variety of sources in order to support that which I think is different than what Gordon is doing right I mean they're relying on just the secure their their their their their services so I can understand why it's probably complex to you know

[02:14:00]
to to argue on this one because on the one hand I will tell you I hear on the other side on the adult ed side for us with Workforce Solutions the number of young people that didn't receive a diploma and don't want to go back through that kind of system and so being able to have an alternative system through an adult ed program is really helpful because it also makes a difference too so there is a lot of services and supports that go hand in hand with that so that we can support them through that program even you know past the age of 22 and I'm glad that they're not part of Gordon Burnell at that point because there are no they're not incarcerated their you know they're out on the outside so they're all so looking at things a little bit differently and this is a tough one I mean it's a tough one

[02:15:00]
take care of too small of a pie you know we're all going after the same resources and they're just trying to figure out where to put those resources to get you know the biggest the biggest impact so I can see why it's difficult well I can tell you right now that most people that get diplomas at the money I guarantee you that all the money that they got there that 6.9 million or whatever 699 so I'm not convinced by any of that I'm not convinced by the it's a different kind of adult program is the point it's a different kind of adult program is not their Workforce Solutions you know we don't have people going into the into the MDC and so forth and saying oh well we'll just do our program over here know we've already got

[02:16:00]
you know my wife and I have talked about this forever about task we love the time on task we need more time to say I need more time that's what this is

[02:17:00]
if they want to give the money for the purpose of saying we need to Target at risk kids and you need to decide how to do that like we did with them are high schools we added days and that's the kind of thing that school needs right Northstar may need a different kind of a program it's not the same necessarily so there are a lot of issues there and I know there's a lot of research that says you know more time here that we've got you know summer programs

[02:18:00]
got all those kind of different things right so how does that all work together and how do we make that work as is our district you know to work best for all the schools that we have well I think we need to be able to decide that ourselves not have that put on us so I'm not not too happy necessarily with the legislature telling us this is what we need to do I think I'm a big believer in more time on task you know but they're very specifically take out recess they take out lunch they take out those things is the counting I think recess is an educational and if we're not careful about it we'll end up taking recess out of the day so you can we already have I mean the fight

[02:19:00]
I know someone was talking about introducing legislation say there must be recess because we know kids need to play it's when their brains can kind of process everything they've gotten so yeah anyway I gave you my comments that's my comments not necessarily broadcasts I was very interested in the school accountability particularly the part where he told me about what the definition of graduation rate was and I said yes that's what the national definition is of a Justin cohort rate that is not how we calculated here in New Mexico so now my question was and I sent this to me because I said I like that definition now did you really mean

[02:20:00]
or are you just letting whatever happens happens here you know with the record counting and whatever that minutiae is because that's how it ought to be counted because I think in fact we are not comparing well with others because somehow that recording is not helping us in identifying people you know and for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about that's okay that's how you're supposed to compare every state is by that definition and I've never got an answer as to how you convert our recording thing into into into these people you know cohort number how many leave how many come in you know how many graduate you know it's people

[02:21:00]
so it'd be nice to know I don't know if maybe he's going to tell me what she thinks about that or not you know maybe I can talk to her and ask her another question but 9:30 members of the board you have a 9 a.m. meeting with Senator Stuart tomorrow morning I do have a meeting as a group 9 a.m. to 9:30 she's blocked off for us tomorrow ok Google

[02:22:00]
legislature in general is supporting this and not supporting this you know so that we kind of know that information so that's good any other comments from the board look forward to this 3 days see what we can do and thank you for all you do I know you're working hard and I know it was a tough day the other day when I called the snowy well you know they say they may be snow Thursday I appreciate it very much

[02:23:00]
you're going to board member comments closing in on things let's start down here with the board member readings all the things I want to tell her all week long I'm able to share with her here so that works out I have no words as it pertains to Cleveland High School when it comes to this kind of stuff so my my heart does go out to the parents and as a parent of a high schooler you know I cry every time this kind of thing happens so it's a tough

[02:24:00]
we are going to be together on and off for the next 3 days at the School Board Association meeting in Santa Fe so I look forward to spending time with each of you and and being in those workshops I look forward to presenting a workshop with with Chris so thank you very much for making me do that and there are also wanted to point out that next week is February 27th is Dolores worth that day up in Santa Fe so I'll be there on that day that will be exciting we also received an invite recently from the City of Albuquerque their equity and inclusion from Michelle and reference to a racial anything that we can do to help support her Department I think would be great and the work that they're trying to do in the community so

[02:25:00]
thank you and I look forward to working with you Chris on Friday so thank you everybody you know is a woman of color I hear you I understand what you're talking about but I would also encourage you to be part of the solution and provide input look forward to working with you as well so I encourage you to you know we want to hear from you but we also like to encourage you to be part of what we are trying to do here in APS but I understand what you're going through as well continue you know have the honor of attending Middle School the the honors Choir The Honor Choir wonderful beautiful voices

[02:26:00]
and the way that they make the that the selection is made for these individuals for the students is is amazing because it's not just about their beautiful voice it's about who they are in school their character and I believe Dr Pierce he was there as well just beautiful it was really an honor to be there and I just really enjoyed this video so I look forward to seeing her back here again period she'll be ahead of everybody and I don't have anything else to say and I think all of you for being here thank you so much

[02:27:00]
also to Mr Coker thank you for continuing to be here at the meetings and also push us I also am a individual who understands that experience of feeling like you're somewhat invisible or that you're not understood or that your issues are not understood having gone through that kind of similar experience myself I can understand the frustration what I can say also is that as a board member I am finding it encouraging that that the district is putting a lot of effort and energy into the issue I think it's not one that comes with just like one Silver Bullet you know that we've got the solution and it's going to happen and it's going to happen

[02:28:00]
open overnight but I am take I am heartened by the efforts and the work that is going on so I'm I'm feeling less and less frustrated by it and there's not a moment that doesn't go by that I don't think about that student and the issue that happened for that particular student I think it's any kind of incident that happens to a student like that is disappointing at the very least disappointing at the most it's also hard it's got wrenching and it's heart-wrenching and those are things that I know that every single one of these board members we take it to heart and there's a lot of there's a lot of sadness around some of the things that we cannot fix but what I will say is that we also remain extremely hopeful because we can't be anything but hopeful we

[02:29:00]
there's so much work that needs to be done and I'm encouraged by the commitment of the district and the the board members that you know that we you know I think we really do put our heart and soul into figuring out how we can be better and we want to be better and we strive to be better I can see it in the actions that we got to celebrate tonight period 500.00 for homeless youth I'm encouraged by those kinds of opportunities that students are giving to bring forward a different side of himself so that they can understand the depth and breadth of their capacity and their ability

[02:30:00]
would you give to our community and also grow themselves so so that also was very humbling and it's also encouraging and then I just you know of course a shout out to all of the union members that were here tonight because it's with them it's their collaboration and it's their commitment to wanting to be a partner with us that also makes our school our school district to better District love those educational assistance because I was raised by one who Who Loved Her schools and you know love the district all the good the bad everything that went with that but she was she was definitely dedicated to every single student in every single family that you know went to our schools in the South Valley terms of the professional development for the Educational Systems one of the things that I would love to see happen at a minimum is include information or include them in any kinds of opportunity to learn about Aces

[02:31:00]
and the impact on child behavior but also a trauma-informed approaches I've seen schools where they've taken educational assistance and made them Partners in that process and it's made them better educational assistance to because they know how to handle those situations when kids get rough and then of course it goes without saying it's just the warning signs of suicide and prevention on that bus drivers and educational assistance of always saved lives in doing that so I I hope that they also get an opportunity to be part of leadership teams I know my mother enjoyed she had the she had the distinct pleasure of working for Don Duran Duran selected my mother to be part of the leadership team in her last four years of working at Ernie Pyle middle school and being part of that leadership team was it was just incredible what it did for her

[02:32:00]
but what it also did for our community because she became part of a team to help students that were struggling in school and identifying them and keeping them connected so I saw that opportunity and how it grew my mother personally and professionally it went a long ways for her and I think that all of our educational assistance really strive for those kinds of opportunities as well and so I just want to give a shout out for them and an advocate on their behalf to be part to be considered part of leadership teams in schools thank you remember I almost think I've said enough to get me in trouble for the next couple of lifetimes you know I want to see Mr absolutely respected what makes sense to you to be said and we will hear you

[02:33:00]
we are in a straitjacket of sorts that we can't comment on your comments I appreciated your questions I couldn't answer them and I was so glad that Dr marmol was able to assemble a team to help begin to answer those questions you know from an old man's perspective I can only tell you that having having been on a parallel path with you maybe from a number of years back I can just say that what we're trying to do mostly is impact the organizational culture of the district and it's a school by school classroom by classroom bases and that's not an easy task and I don't know that very well and the institutions of Higher Learning and we got a lot of people that are just trying to keep one nostril sewage when it comes to paycheck to paycheck

[02:34:00]
who are trying to do the best they can to serve their their children but it's a it's a tough set of circumstances that's not a good excuse It's Not Meant to Be an excuse for the racism that exists that has existed for a number of years but I do think that we as a board have operated on the idea of intentionality we intend to move this District forward we've done lots of things that I believe are Innovative interesting and provoke a lot of reaction on people who see things completely opposite do what we do and I guess it's just part of human nature but it's all so a manipulation of sorts and we've been under attack as a board ever since I've been on and I can only say that I appreciate

[02:35:00]
is it coming I appreciate you sharing and I'm more than happy to meet with you individually if you'd like I can give you my perspective and that and you know five bucks might buy you a cup of espresso coffee someplace but I'm one of seven and my 7th of 7th is not any less important and not any more important as a board we try to act in a way where we move forward as a board and that's different from my individual experience and or opinions when we can we try to Enlighten each other to come to terms with what it is we're grappling with but it is it's a long road we're attempting to walk and we have to continue to find ways to find leverage and I think you're doing that and you're coming here means a lot to me that you are willing to stick it out so thank you Peterson I remember

[02:36:00]
a couple of things from legislative stuff that's actually good news one is that I think we can be really confident that there's going to be support for Community Schools and that it's going to express itself and some dollars for coordinators and it's it's such a market difference from past years when we couldn't even get it onto the table really for real discussion and so that's exciting it's probably going to be part of the governor's package have had a long-standing relationship and really had a wonderful mentorship program that hasn't been funded and it's going to be

[02:37:00]
we've been self-funding APS is continued to send it but it hasn't been funded at the state level and it's looking like it's going to be a line item in the budget to actually have money to support new teachers entry level teachers and that's that's really exciting I was at the nmsba board of directors meeting which is why I'm late and they're just a couple of things that came to my attention that and I'm going to bring it up now so that I don't forget and because Brenda is such a wonderful job of keeping us on track of things that we need to attend to the scholarship program is up and running and the SBS putting aside 24,000 so they'll be a thousand dollars for

[02:38:00]
play individuals from each of the regions and we so we need to decide on we need to figure out the process for being able to submit a name for a scholarship recipient from the nmsba and then the other other one is there's an excellent student Achievement Award which is for adults that impact student learning and it can be community and that we get to pick a person we could actually pick more than one if we pay for the plaque so anyway those are things that we can put on the list to address and there were a couple of interesting things from the New Mexico Athletic Association that I thought was interesting because I guess they've had a lot of discussion going on

[02:39:00]
around transfers and how long you have to sit out for transfers and so the existing transfer policy is going to stay in place except and actually the only school that this applies to if a student transfers into Sandia high school they didn't name Sandia high school but it's the only school that it applies to for the international Baccalaureate program if they if they transfer in for that program and stay in that program period

[02:40:00]
district and so nmsba his joined on to your lawsuit contesting the The Authority that the PD secretary that the Secretary of Ed would have to Simply Grant a charter school so that's that's an interesting thing the other the other thing is that we need to figure out a process for giving input on Essa because the standing the existing discipline was based on the grades and there's a very short window for submitting and we need to figure out I think how to get both from the community input from probably how to replace with a valid valid message

[02:41:00]
I think most directly is a dashboard and what that looks like it's hard to find it you have to go to the administrators into so many other things we have is a district such a challenge and having good conversation

[02:42:00]
mission in communication with the community it's just hard it's we look for lots of different ways of doing it and so when the idea of the podcast came up I was really kind of skeptical about its efficacy but I listened and I thought that the podcast was really well done and I hope that people can figure out ways like at the school level and at other school places to use it is a tool to have further discussion because I really was quite impressed with with with just how professional it was how informative it was I thought it was substantive and I was good but then that brings up something else I listen to k a n w all the time and I would like to know why did every single day

[02:43:00]
about what a wonderful school they are and how they have low enrollment and how they have all of these opportunities on K A&W data charter school has an ad on their come to our open house and I just I mean talk about if you want to make me hot under the collar it's like why don't we have ads on there for Whittier Elementary School we have an amazing genius hour we have an extended here come to Albuquerque High and you will have one of what a World Cup 2018

[02:44:00]
so that's that's something that I think we need to take care of and I mean talking about Community Schools so much of what's going on I think there it's the colonel the community school framework is that little colonel of how do we bring the community in how do we make substantive that connection with the community it doesn't work well in this format but I think I think the community school councils have that essence of how do we have meaningful real intercommunication conversation with the community and finally I'll add on to the conversation that's already gone I have a half finished and it's really there were lots of things that I couldn't answer

[02:45:00]
is there a couple of things that I'm proud of that we've done as a district but I think we deserve some recognition for when the and when I read the part about working with the PD now I think we have a PD that wants to work with us and that we can work with but I was thinking you know one of the things that I'm proud of of this board and this district is that when the PED tried to change the the bilingual the opportunities for bilingual programs and tried to limit what that would look like APS joined together with many of the tribal governments to push back on that and make sure it didn't happen to say community Snow White program should look like and we're going to stand by that when the PD talk about Manifest Destiny and tried to change the social studies

[02:46:00]
I mean tried to change the end of course exams that would reflect a much more restrictive and and just isolated and racist program we pushed back on that one of the things that has made our relationship through the past 8 years Antichrist is that we have pushed back on things I'm optimistic now that we're in a different environment that we can move forward we have 500 years of Community Based on racism and we have something we have a challenge to take on and I think we're committed to doing that and it but it's not simple and it's going to take time and we need to work on it and so hopefully

[02:47:00]
all the steps that were taking get us closer and closer you know we've been we've been pushed a lot for an apology and you know I think every person up here can go I am so sorry this is so outrageous but it's so meaningless I mean anyone here can apologize but that's not what's going to make a difference is figuring out what's the action that we need to take and how are we going to build that and so we have work to do without a doubt thank you just a few of the things that I worry about with what are optimism is here with our new budget

[02:48:00]
you're very very positive is I worry about the sustainability of the recurring funds I really do and you mentioned availability you know in other words it's great to say we've got some more money the question is do we have people to do the job we really need to get done you know I mean it's going to be a big question to us too and so I hope you really are thinking towards the question of how we really do sustain this over time right I mean I love all the ideas I love the excitement I love the collaborations on education you know we really need to focus on supporting those things that are going to help the whole economy you know and so I look forward to that I can't tell you how much I enjoyed talking with

[02:49:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:50:00]
what's fantastic stuff so and I did you know I thank you board member Patterson for mention the middle school on acquire is great to see them I also went down to Lew Wallace I didn't know where Lou Wallace was I've only been here 10 years you know why would I know where Lou Wallace is but I found the Wallace it's what I might call my inner city school and I went down there because I wanted to see how this school enrichment model work and I was really impressed we had a person there who was from from Connecticut

[02:51:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:52:00]
I enjoyed it and so I'm I'm I'm I'm by that I think it's I think it's good stuff I think it's the things that help us get this integration of talents and and abilities and differing abilities you know and I went to the retired Educators luncheon we had a prime speaker here or superintendent I think we probably need to do a little more for a retard Educators you know I know when we have our retirement ceremonies you know that we need to have them involved in this a little bit and make sure that all the retirees get notified about you know this organization and how they can be a part of it so and superintendent reading did a great job I think in terms of helping them understand a little bit more about what we're doing so I was great I really didn't enjoy that and for for my Joseph who's not

[02:53:00]
I'd like to meet with Karen Trujillo or secretary doesn't it I'd like to talk with her I'd like to take care and I want to let you know that APS is here and we certainly appreciate you and if we can be of any help at all or service you know we need to make that connection so maybe sometime when we're up there we'll get a chance to meet her and say hello and I appreciate being here thank you very much I think you were speaking specifically to some my comments so I will be very careful about my comments and I think we're making a lot of progress in terms of getting coordination and some of the suggestions you have

[02:54:00]
to our people and maybe some responses back so I think that's going to be a positive thing and and I think again if we can have more face-to-face meetings where I can kind of talk these things out more quickly I think we'll probably get a little better resolution in terms of some of the information that's useful both from you to us and us to you so I think that will be useful and so I look forward to continuing that process so hopefully that'll help and appreciate you staying around the whole time to hear this so thank you for the board members you've heard that so I appreciate what you said I appreciate your suggestions so that's pretty much what I have to say so the next board meeting will be Wednesday March 6th 5 p.m.

[02:55:00]
when's the next space shuttle at Board of Education meeting will be Monday February 25th and that's actually going to be available for real Finance meeting in reality so hey Google
