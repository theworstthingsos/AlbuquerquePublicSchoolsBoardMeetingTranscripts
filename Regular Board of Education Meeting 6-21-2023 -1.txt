Brad's Mobile Alabama brief moment of silence for those that are serving our country and just for our children and families in general please period YouTube channel our first item

[00:02:00]
is adoption of the 20 of the June 21st 2023 Board of Education meeting agenda and approval of the June 7th 2023 Board of Education meeting minutes and the June 5th 2023 special Board of Education meeting minutes I'll move for the adoption of the June 21st 2023 Board of Education meeting agenda with the removal from consent item by a one and then approval of the June 7th 2023 Board of Education meeting minutes and the June 5th 2023 special Board of Education meeting minutes I have a second this is supposed to be no thank you on

[00:03:00]
no secretary Jackson you don't have to have any instructions tonight so I will move on with our with our next item and it's on to the consent agenda item so I think before we go on to discussion of A1 let's have a consideration for approval of the consent agenda items to I guess it's just a two and do I have a motion for that I'll move for approval of agenda item five the consent agenda all right so let's have a roll call on that first email address yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I am is consideration for approval of the architectural selection advisory committees recommendation for Award of architectural services Early Child

[00:04:00]
Center to SMP Architects so I think what I'd like to do first is just go ahead and have a motion on that and then we'll have discussion do I have a motion I moved this week except item A1 consideration for approval of the architectural selection advisory committees recommendation for a word of architectural services for jeronis Early Childhood Center to smpc Architects don't have a second I guess we'll start with you you had some discussion items on questions on this I mean I just had a lot of questions back since you know probably about over a month ago some of them were answered but all of them were dancing so I would just appreciate answers to these questions so I'm not sure if Dr Blakey you'll be the one that answered them all or depends on the

[00:05:00]
it'll be the question that you all had already received so I did go through cuz we did receive all the preschools and what they're waiting list look like and we I finally got to look at them they were took a little bit of time just because we couldn't get access to them and so I looked at all of them and what I found is I think there were five that we didn't have numbers for as of I don't know probably an hour ago or something so I didn't have those five numbers but I looked at all the other numbers and found that of the schools I think there's like 55 just traditional schools and then there was some Charter Schools but of those there were only of those 55 just traditional schools there were only 15 Seitz that had all their classes for from the numbers that you sent and I counted up and I

[00:06:00]
I have counted wrong cuz I was doing this you know last minute but I counted 706 total accepted children so I'm assuming that those numbers are the most up-to-date and those are the correct numbers I will ask Miss Gormley if you can answer the programmatic questions about the Early Childhood enrollment I believe with the Early Childhood that a lot of students enter when school starts but I'm not sure I can't see who's on Zoom so I couldn't tell if Cheryl is on can you repeat the question

[00:07:00]
so it's a board member I mean I know that we had during the right size and committee we had an opportunity to go through like all the vacancies and some of the concerns and they had given us where the vacancies existed you felt like because they do say here the New Mexico Pre-K classroom as there's 56 sites 76 programs and then they listed where we had vacancies and are you stating that with the information that you received that you it appears that there's more vacancies or just got the numbers I was unable to compare them to that since they were just coming in slowly so I wasn't able to compare those so I am just I mean I'm curious and I and this is probably the question is if there are 7006 so far that are registered or accepted to the preschool

[00:08:00]
but yet one of the numbers that we were given is that we had 15 I think it was $1,500 so I won members I have not seen the the latest data that you're looking at so what that could be is last year at the end of last year prior to enrollment for next year we had the vacancies that were reported at the right sizing meeting and those vacancies were based on if a classroom is too large but we still have students that we open up another classroom but it may only filter 60 so then there's 11 Seasons available in that position or that program so I don't know what next year's enrollments are I think this was for it appeared that this was the enrollment as of May of 2023 that's what that's what it looked like to me is June 19th 2023 yeah so um board

[00:09:00]
member the issue that Miss grandma is bringing up is that at the right size meeting what you saw was a combination of last year's what you're seeing now I believe that the Early Childhood department is where they are so far with registration but a lot of the Pre-K and kindergarten students come in as we get close to school starting for registration so I'm sure when they update those numbers like in mid-august you'll see a yes sir kind of going back to school so those would be good numbers for us to be able to see their you know of the ones that did have you know waiting list there were you know there were too many and the concerned that I had was some of them is some of them have like zero like they had nobody there were several schools where there was like two

[00:10:00]
there were a couple like one two three four I think that had like none so I might have some clarify that for me I don't understand so let me say buy this stuff had only three one of on the 123 and the other two classes that they have teachers for had nobody accepted in their classes so they only have three and one class and the other two classes that I'm assuming they must have had this past year that they're hoping to fill I think it could also be I'm not looking at the dad in front of me but it if it's a DC program it could be that we build those based on previous enrollment so that when students are identified and in need we have the programs available for them I don't believe that we added any additional programs but

[00:11:00]
the students qualifying or showing need for those programs that's a constant coming from like child find etcetera the developmental preschool classroom is very different because they did describe to us in the right size of committee the need to keep those are much shows are much smaller classes because you can see there's like three or two and I understand that they had one app when I was teaching at Petroglyph so it's much smaller class so I do understand that so it would just be good to just keep us updated on what those numbers like what those numbers are and then I know I had the waiting they did update the waiting list and then we already had the vacancies so that was that was fine so then the question this price is going to go to you this probably going to go to doctor Blakey Duran is this new

[00:12:00]
duranes Early Childhood Center proposed is going to be built to house 300 students as we were told at the right sizing committee correct at this time what we are asking for is the approval of the design for it to create a center that would hold up to you period okay and so then I know the question that I don't think that was my question was in order to make to get to 100% capacity that would be 300 students and that would take from what I saw is going to take like several that would take several years to get their correct it could just for clarification the consolidation the closing of la Luz made those made a domino effect for Bonita and so because of

[00:13:00]
the consolidation of the programs in the North Valley particularly is all housed at Joanna so even as soon as next year that program will be over a hundred students in the first year just with the current Consolidated programs there so that's the domino effect from La Luz has an impact on duranes and at the beginning of the right size I think the probably the first meeting duranes was identified I think as the first I'm just looking at the top priority of a school meeting to be right size so there's kind of two things going on where we have to do something with Duran's due to just the Matrix of how we looked at schools that needed to be right size and then as we close to lose we have a consolidation now of programs at Doris okay I did I did see that so we're anticipating the inaugural year

[00:14:00]
which we are not exactly sure when that's going to happen for sure cuz we have to get all the other infrastructure at this other schools taken care of as well so we just anticipate that there will be right now 100 students and then we expect that in time to grow to 300 okay then what and I know this is just maybe hard to answer but you really anticipate you're really pretty positive that we're going to have 100 students that first year I wouldn't say 100% positive but I'm pretty confident that based on Duran's as of last year had 48 preschool students without the consolidation of programs so just based on the consolidation of programs in the growth we're seeing in the DP

[00:15:00]
will be probably close to 100 just with the Consolidated programs that are going in for next year and then I did see that you all did get me the information about some of the construction that had been done lately so they had added a classroom Block in the late 2000s and then they had also done a boiler conversion and evaporative cooler etcetera so when they are and I know this committee is going to figure out how that's going to look how much of that that's newer are they going to even be able to use of that classroom block so they'll be able I might call Mr widget of the school and visiting the newest addition is a preschool Block in Early Child in a kindergarten Wing So that new edition of a wing is would be utilized in this the part of the school that needs

[00:16:00]
regardless because it is identified as one of the top facilities for right sizing that would need to be rebuilt but the the newest construction at that school is Early Childhood classrooms now okay that's what I that's what I thought so that's good that they would be able to to use that because I'd be ashamed to knock something down that's not that that old so do you have any idea Dr Blakey about how many square feet or that's not going to even come into play yet if you want to house 300 students I know there are specifications for Early Childhood centers that you have to meet so do you have an idea about how many square feet this is going to be if you exclude the 10,000 square feet that's already already there miss already know the square footage of the Early Childhood design I do not

[00:17:00]
have that off the top of my head but I will tell you that one of the first things we're going to do is look at all the buildings and see if any of them with the exception of the newest building our salvageable and can be reused so but I can get you the square footage of a $300 cuz I'm sure that that is just you know there are those standards that you have to meet so okay if you could that be that'd be good they aren't you they aren't you and so the total the total cost for this architectural design is supposed to be that three million dollars that's going to come from Esther funds is that seemed High to me but maybe it's not the correct number OK Google okay and so once I mean cuz we don't know what the score I know every square foot cost right now are really high so

[00:18:00]
and we could be at over $400 a square foot possibly and then just meeting all those standards that we have to meet so we don't really have any idea what the whole construction cost would be the salary yes we do my finger on it and I know that the 3 million is going to come or the 900,000,000 by next September so that will just have to come from somewhere that will have to come from somewhere else then

[00:19:00]
okay the thing that that I was just told from families that when they saw that we were going to be using Esser funds for this prototype design was that they thought that wasn't a plate and I haven't been able to answer them because I haven't got a question they thought that it should be used for students that we have right now to help them recover our academically from you know all the trauma and everything that you know all the Lost learning that they had to go through during covid and so if you could tell me how I can give an answer to them because those are students that are going to be new students that were not affected by covid-19 should be spent on that so how can I answer them so in that as refunds we have about 220 million dollars so the money that would be invested

[00:20:00]
play in the community for these buildings primarily looking at just what we need to do with the facility of duranes would be an investment in making sure that what we've seen in students from the effects of the pandemic having the need for Early Childhood staying with needed for our investment in elementary I think shows the benefit the cost benefit of investing these dollars on future generation of students who have been impacted in the community when we've seen the loss of students throughout the district as well so pulling students in and bring them into the district early also helps with us being able to increase our enrollment and it's a very yeah it's a very small percent so if

[00:21:00]
we and I think I believe that the next Finance meeting will be going over the Esser dollars that we've the $220 million budget and you will see in that presentation the amount of money that has been used to directly impact the students in the classroom and learning lost in a lot of Miss gormley's team and her work on what they're doing with those funds so we'll be able to go over that the next meeting okay because I think that's just an important one to answer and then I know that I got we got the cost of leaving around us open so this last year it cost 3.3 million dollars to operate around us and so I didn't have a chance to look at the whole thing so what is it going to cost yearly to operate the Early Childhood Center I think Miss avocado is on to answer the specifics of that and the money from the so the money for the

[00:22:00]
Early Childhood Program is a little bit different because it's coming from the state not through operational dollars so that the budget of it is a little bit different but I think you get 10,000 per student so if you have a 100 then we figure out how much that is you get to 300 and we travel are you on or Miss Montoya she tricked us I'm here I don't know where my my video keeps turning off there it is yeah and so I don't know if you which version of the cost benefit you have in front of you but yeah if if you if we leave it as is we see that we continue to lose more money it goes more and more negative each year because we're assuming

[00:23:00]
you know even if we just lost five students which has been the trend we get less and less Revenue per se and the cost actually increases because we put a 3% on FTE escalation on that and so you just see that the huge loss and then on the top the cop shows the cost for the for the Pre-K with only you know starting with a little bit of a if we only have the 100 students or the 1224 for the first year you would go slightly negative and then after that you like either Break Even or gain money and so even if we stayed at only the 124 100 students and we still lost

[00:24:00]
a little bit money it still is a huge cost benefit as to just leaving Duran is as is I hope that answered your question I thought that's about what what it would be so we just even if we think cuz I don't anticipate we're going to have a whole bunch more people having more children that they're not going to be there but you're saying even if we just stay at the 1204 that will pretty close to to break even very early so we will I mean we won't be operating in the red for very long period let me just make sure that all those are all the questions that because a lot of them got answered and I tried to check them off as they as they did so then the only other thing that I thought was important I know you have came up with this early design

[00:25:00]
The Design Group that's going to be helping and so I know that we had asked to make sure that we had other private providers because the majority of them were government staff and so I thought that was very very important to have those conversations with those community-based leaders out there I was just looking around my neighborhood and how many Early Childhood centers there are how many preschools are and just not within a few miles of where I live I counted like a dozen Just Between the you know churches between Early Childhood centers between home base centers and you know just affecting 503 just doesn't seem to go up just doesn't you know seem to be the wisest wisest thing to do and then some of the other questions if you all can just

[00:26:00]
if I can get some of the answers some of the other answers that have more to do with the right size and then have to do with duranes and what I can do is just resend those to Johanna to send to you so I'm not wasting more time talking about something that's not talking about tonight well then also we just need to use our right size and committee to to bring those questions up during the committee conversation so hopefully you'll have those prepared and when we come to the right size and committee we're having the discussion and we can do that all right so is there any other discussion I do I go ahead I have some questions because I attended the right size and committee and obviously not able to ask questions because I'm not on that committee my biggest concern again is seeing the amount of vacancies that show you know on our list and this is carries through from last year and then obviously this year as well and and let me back up a little bit how many slots

[00:27:00]
anticipated to move over to Durant's I don't works and then the additional Zuni immersion language classroom I believe they had three classrooms this year so there was three currently in now know there were three currently at Duran's and then they moved the current location to 7 because they're moving the loose MacArthur and coaching the coach TV and the Zuni emerging program okay and those are strictly Pre-K slots that you're referring to yes and well I think two of those classrooms are the DPC classrooms as well okay so out of the seven

[00:28:00]
currently now looking forward that we still have yet to fill new slots when I know there's programs throughout the city that have already been able to sustain and you know with withhold going forward I see community-based providers like this is their livelihood and what they're doing and we're anticipating putting this new program out there when we haven't even filled with what we currently have and ultimately hurt other businesses her other providers that are already doing the same type of service it

[00:29:00]
it's no secret this is what I've done for over 20 years and I won't and I am a huge advocate that parents should have a choice to be able to pick whatever type of environment that they fill their student should best learn out whether it's public private faith-based whatever that's a family's choice but again I can't justify seeing that we have declining birth rates our own APS enrollment has a decline we're not feeling our current spots yet we think now that we have this Hub it's going to suddenly be filled and we're going to have this trajectory of filling 300 students I don't see how that happens and again when we have multiple other providers within the same area that are providing identical Services because it's the same standards we're following there's not anything different on how we're going to pull these children because ultimately

[00:30:00]
when we look at the grid the first year it is in the red I know we say it's not a lot it's $180,400 plus and we're hoping we'll go up I don't know where these students are going to come from go ahead I was just going to say I think the key difference is the Constitutional Amendment where is last year Pre-K education for 3:40 coming school year it is so I think that's where the kids are coming from and what I understood from the right says in committee was decisions on long-term growth in early childhood and additional hubs and how that was going to happen and what's the saturation of Public School pre-k versus Pre-K will depend on recommendations from the new committee so I think a lot of those things are still TBD and I agree with board member Gonzalez

[00:31:00]
because what I've also heard is that this whole conversation that because of that amendment that there is going to be this newer expectation especially for like even public schools around creating opportunity to make that available and I think what we're only trying to do here is also to to create an opportunity for us to figure out how we can do that will it work you know will this hubing be the the answer I'm also looking at pre-k classrooms and if you just look at just the vacancies in this particular Zone there's only one vacancy which also tells me something there too because so I don't and then the consolidation also just has me concerned because we already approved those boundary changes and we are already approved that shifting so those families already have been dis

[00:32:00]
did somewhat and and their need were planning to consolidate that already and I think it was an opportunity for us also to be responsive to what the new educational Act is asking for around early childhood and at least being you know a little bit forward if you were thinking forward so that we can design something that we have an opportunity with the community providers with the parents in the community and as I understand board member Gonzalez your community was pretty responsive to this correct yeah they had been they've come out and have been really responsive around this is something that they see is useful in their Community when we first came to the right size and committee I know there was like grand plan it was Grand gesture and I kind of like went back whoa wait a minute because it I wasn't sure and I like the idea of a starting here first figuring out

[00:33:00]
everything that we need to do and then moving forward with hubing as potential because there's also this concern that some parents definitely like it when it's at a school as well because it helps with drop off and it helps with all of those pieces but in this particular instance we've run out of room at the schools that were consolidating and so there isn't that capacity but it's still within the same neighborhoods and it helps those families that are going to be helped in this area we also heard from some families that desire to also want to have their Pre-K students in a like group as well I mean it was kind of half and half but this is an opportunity for us to have those Pre-K classrooms together and that professional development in that networking within that particular group and I also heard just the the potential around the DPC side of it because

[00:34:00]
I understand what you're saying and we believe that that families should have a choice to especially when it comes to pre-k programs I have six grandchildren for have either gone or been in some pretty great program from anywhere from Facebook private and now in one of our own Pre-K programs so I support Family Choice I also know because I have a daughter that runs an Autism Center they have been looking for a building for over a year and I also heard that a right size committee eccd funds the program but there's no money for facilities we are fortunate that we have the infrastructure that can provide the facilities along

[00:35:00]
with the program and so we are serving a community need by using our facilities that meet the requirements of An Early Childhood Center to provide Community programs right and I'm familiar with the whole process because again this is what I do and I think there's a lot of misconceptions out there because e c e c d does Provide Capital money for community-based programs to be able to do remodeling do you expand buildings I only know because I was awarded that you know so I know it's there so I think there's a lot of misconception there when board member Monterey Court of us said that there's only one spot I'm looking at what's listed here for Joanna's and it shows that there's nine spots left in each classroom so I don't know you know what data your reviewing this is just based on what we were sent now okay and it goes back to and I feel like

[00:36:00]
we have not collaborated with providers you know the providers that we show that were listed on there were not essentially true community-based providers like we have people from the city from the state from other organizations but it's not people who are truly have done this and it affects their Community their families their businesses and it's unfortunate because that's a Pre-K standard that we're required to collaborate with programs in our area and aps's badly at that I know firsthand because I have called to have been like we have some openings can you share your wait list and they will not share information or we say vice versa we have extra and no one will actually work with us on how we can you know work as a team to best serve these families so I see how we haven't even completely

[00:37:00]
let the need met the standard been able to operate the program and I guess the way it should be and to be able to look ahead and be like okay now we're going to create this great Hub which I think it has a lot of potential but there's still a lot of unanswered questions for me or to be able to support why we need this so and again we've had providers talk many times that come in and smoke a public comment and say no one's talking to us no one's collaborated and to this day no one has ever done anything with them you know and I'm like why are we reaching out to these people who said that they wanted to support and be part of the conversation any other discussion go ahead and Peterson I can I think I can agree with board member top of your room and board member Miller about the importance of making sure that our programs are developmentally appropriate making sure

[00:38:00]
did we really recognize that young children need make sure that we don't make them look like first grade and second grade for 4-year-olds and I think we've got a lot of Unity on that point but I do I did hear the exact same arguments against APS in the state expanding kindergarten that it wasn't it wasn't something that many families were aware of and committed to until the service was right there and accessible and easy way and I think for many of these meetings and LFC meetings that I have said that over and over again when we talked about how are students do in school one of the huge hurdles is that we do not have

[00:39:00]
adequate preschool for our three and four year olds and it's something that we really have to take seriously I don't think it's I think there will always be people who have private providers that they are absolutely committed to that they adore that they would never leave under any circumstance but there we know that there's a huge number of families that feel many barriers for one reason or another and we have the ability and responsibilities to figure out like what do we what are we going to do for extended care how how do we partner with other providers to make sure that for those families where they have to leave a child at 7:00 a.m. and cancel 7:00 p.m. consequently rely on some combination of extended family and

[00:40:00]
papers and other people how can we meet those needs because it's a serious serious need but those are things that it's our responsibility to take on and solve but I feel like this commitment to this physical entity is the first step that we can take okay any other questions I mean we have emotion and we have a second we could just call the vote and we'll see where we are at verification how long have we had an early childhood executive director the new oh my good morning or an instructional manager and it is now an executive I think it's a senior director it's not an executive director of the senior director and she was hired I believe in March

[00:41:00]
so she's fairly new to the role but she's hit the ground running and I think it's doing a great job and I believe she has reached out to many community members including a woman that was here at the board meeting I believe that she has I know at least one and that's not a lot and it's not nearly enough but it's a start I don't think she's hesitant at all to have communication and partnership with our community providers and our private providers and okay well we had someone in that spot before which was married on so it's not necessarily a new position but I need directions yeah I just want to like bring it back home so

[00:42:00]
what it in three sentences what exactly are you asking us to vote on right now is it 900 offer up three sentences is it $900,000 to approve an architectural firm to start a prototype build out for the school just to the design is that what you're asking us to so it's just the design we're not starting construction worker just you're just asking us to approve a design that potentially is going to be at Duran's that we now have kids coming from losing that are going to be there this is a hub this is a prototype this is we're just gave more than three sentences but I just want to make sure yes because I feel

[00:43:00]
we we kind of got off on it we got off on a tangent which understandably I mean I totally understand why we're on this tangent cuz I get it I'm not sure that the needs their either but I just want to make sure what are you asking us to vote on so today Madam chair members of the board we're asking you to vote on the approval of the architectural selection for an architectural firm that will be tasked with designing a project apparatus and how long do we anticipate that and design work is going to take will they typically take about a year but we are up against the SR fund deadline which is September of 2024 so we will definitely have to be done by then period August 3rd of 2023

[00:44:00]
are kids coming to durante's starting in 2 months yes in the current infrastructure at the school okay so this Early Childhood Center isn't going to happen till 2024 or or the they're coming in the current structure yes okay thank you and so you're asking us to prove 900,000 for something that's potentially going to take a year in that year there's a possibility things could change right sure yes okay 90000 like that's what I can't find the 900,000 in our package not asking you to approve the dollar amount we're only asking you to prove the selection of the architectural firm the 900,000 came

[00:45:00]
response to board member Mueller Aragon when she asked how much the architectural fees were going to be for this particular design and so you're estimating under a million that's okay that's where there was like some confusion is where was the amount so it's really just the architectural firm yes thank you all right so we have emotion and we have a second I want to call for the boat no I just don't believe it's needed and I'm also concerned for developmental appropriateness of pre-K Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes this will tell you about it Jackson carries our next item is

[00:46:00]
just some discussion here this is for me let me pull myself together here so what I wanted to just do is to give or know we're on the negotiated agreement right now yeah we're moving right along here all right so on our to give an update for those books that might be listening so what comes next so we began to shift our new form of governance nearly a year ago I can't believe it's already been that long and we've come a long way but we still have some work to do we now have four goals that reflect the vision of our community which made it clear which were made clear during the listening sessions that they want Albuquerque Public Schools to focus on early literacy

[00:47:00]
play efficiency post-secondary Readiness and making sure that our students have the skills habits and mindsets for Life success so there they are the aps goals and guardrails will all become pretty accustomed to it I will say it was heartwarming to be at a meeting yesterday and you can hear the staff already talking about student outcomes don't change until adult behaviors change and recognizing the importance of our goals and guard rails we've also committed to honoring the community's values the guards as we direct the superintendent's work towards achieving these goals and we expect our schools to provide wrap around support systems Equitable allocation of resources and high-quality curriculum and instruction while engaging families in the community and providing support and voice to the staff and while the board is focused on the goals and guard rails Administration developed a strategic plan prioritizing its work towards accomplishing the goals they're all so designed interim goals and guard rails that will help measure progress and I believe in our

[00:48:00]
so that we can get some information on those or get you some responses back to you so we are now about halfway through our implementation timeline that's kind of crazy and it's kind of scary at the same time we have set the expectation that the budget team will align resources to goals and guard rails and I think we've done really good job of doing that that was indicative of just the budget that we passed and feeling confident about where we were and some board members are working on board operating procedures and others are working on a policy review and as policy chair Gonzalez noted at the last policy committee meeting we should see the results of both efforts in early August the finance department is also working on a student outcomes focused budget policy that we hope to review in August in addition I am preparing to a point of community engagement planning committee to plan

[00:49:00]
student outcomes Focus governance is is it's not just a one and done we're going to go back out to the community so that we can share where we are I know there's a lot of excitement around the Strategic plan because there's also going to be the you know sort of the unveiling and saying here this is here's where we are but we're going to be getting we're going to have to gear up for a lot of community engagement I think this fall because we're also going to be engaging in a superintendent search which I'll talk about next let's see beginning this fall will start monitoring the progress toward meeting the goals and guardrails which is really where the hard work is is really around the monitoring piece and so before we do that we have to learn how so tomorrow June 22nd the members of the Board of Education and key administrators will be attending training with our coaches from the great City schools and hope everyone has done their homework so there was three reading assignments and I just want to acknowledge

[00:50:00]
board member Dominguez and board member Jackson also for participating in the cohort that were part of cuz I think we've learned a little bit about progress monitoring and have had a chance to engage with other school boards and just sort of watching and hearing from them what's working and what's not working so I thought that's been I don't know for me personally I think it's been really helpful to listen to to what's going on and just to be engaged with other board members from across the country that have been doing this work or starting this work but just hearing where we are and some of the struggles and the challenges but the progress monitoring part I think is really going to be where the it's going to be exciting but it's all and where the rubber hits the road exactly so the administration is preparing a five year monitoring calendar so the board will know what goals and guardrails to measure at each meeting and we will begin the process when we get results from the from the ELA and math assessment probably in September so that's

[00:51:00]
but we're still waiting on Remembrance for that final assessment so that we can kind of figure out where we're starting and where we're going to have so I just want to thank all the board members and the staff who have worked so hard on this effort and I'll just open it up here if there's anything else that the board members would like to add around student outcomes Focus governance or anyone have anything to do it I think the most exciting piece of this is that we are representing the visions and vision angles of our community and I think once we went out into the community listen to parents Community leaders they they came to the same visions and so for me it's it's helpful right

[00:52:00]
so yeah I'm excited and I'm looking forward to more Community engagements I think that's going to be the best part is when we get a chance to go back out any other comments no go ahead yeah I have a question just about the interplay between our progress monitoring the establishment of a district level accountability system assessment and accountability system and the PD's New Mexico Vistas and their recent release of schools designated for improvement so that list came out there are many many things from the district around which are those schools what the plan is how they're going to take advantage of some of the supports from ped but really like where's the coherence for all of these pieces and as I asked that

[00:53:00]
I think it's really important for us to figure out how to put all these pieces together I agree with you because I what I've been watching when I watch like other boards and asking just people that I'm working with to just on other states it's like through the progress monitoring it's like somehow all of that does get to come into play because we as board members will have that kind of you know tucked into the back of our heads and as we're getting ready with questions that were asking I think those are the those are the ways that we get there because it's that it's that strategic question too is like how is this impacting the TSI schools or the you know the schools that we have listed here for improvement how does the how does the data show up how does it represent how is it represented in terms of the kinds of progress that's being made there so I think it really helps direct us as board members too around

[00:54:00]
things that we want to know about what our students know and are able to do and what schools are doing and then it really becomes that engagement in that conversation I'm not sure that we're going to tackle everything all at once and what I've also seen from the process is that it's really wonky when it first starts out the whole progress monitoring doesn't go over it's not it's not just like easy initially and I can see why it's not because I think we're going to have to get used to asking good questions and thinking really strategically about what we want to know rather than just focusing on just the why did you do it that way kind of thing or what you know what did you know who was there what was there but really sort of looking at the strategy behind it and asking around that question of why did we pick that why why did we pick this particular straight

[00:55:00]
and what are we seeing as the specific outcomes for the students that we want to serve but I think it's going to be a work in progress and I think we're going to we're going to all get better at it and I don't think it's going to be you know all at once but your questions on the record and I think that's a good question to have out there and so tomorrow progress in the practice and I also have a tremendous sense of urgency because of the the I don't know the tragedy of these really bad and considering that we're only a few months from school opening and thinking about how we allocate resources being people time and money it would be very helpful to see a plan for how the district's going to respond to those designations so maybe tomorrow when we have our Workshop you could ask that question too in terms of what kind of God is they give each other school districts in terms of how you could pull that intersection together around all those things somehow

[00:56:00]
the superintendent thank you any other comments go ahead Barbara and I think I absolutely agree with the urgency but not with a sense of panic I mean I listened in on the nape report today and it was interesting because basically everyone I mean it may be that we are on a certain place in the whole bill curve is shifted in terms of our urgency is the historical urgency not a panic right at the second right at this moment it's how do we how do we really deal with a lot of the realities that are Community FAQ

[00:57:00]
I mean the other thing that I've done just recently is I wanted to look and see sort of where from the kids count reports where we stand and basically when you look at that and take acknowledging we've just been through a pandemic even before that for a whole variety of reasons Nate scores were going down starting from about 2015 not here specifically but Nationwide we mirror what's happening Nationwide so anyways I was looking at the kids count and basically the states where kids are being taken care of Education

[00:58:00]
no access to health care and I don't say that as an excuse I'm just saying that if we don't take that into account as we look at fruit causes and how we set up what we do is a school and partnership to everyone else we're going to miss the mark because there aren't silver bullets kids are whole entities and so I just I will never ever say that we don't need to get better at what we do that is never what I'm going to say but I also think we have a reality and we and it was interesting looking at some of the materials for tomorrow doesn't mean that we don't take the gold seriously

[00:59:00]
but but as we address how we move towards them it's not simple one of their little breath of fresh air that was because I was sort of cringing at the idea of tuning into the nape report they ended with a panel that included teachers and students and it was it was powerful and it was real and I just think we need to look at where we are in a national context with basically the entire country looking at the same issues of how do we support students and move forward with the best part of the name

[01:00:00]
I'm hopeful I still am hopeful that I think with a focused you know just being focused on the outcomes and having the conversations I think it'll help us to learn I think where we have some strength of where are challenges are I'm hopeful I feel a sense of urgency as well because I do want our kids to do better I don't know anybody that doesn't but I'm also hopeful that we're setting the conditions and we're creating the conditions that will help everybody that's in that setting in a school the teachers the staff everybody on our parents and our community that we're creating those conditions to have you know just a more thoughtful approach conversation and thinking about

[01:01:00]
and I'm hoping that what we're going to learn through our progress monitoring or where we have some really strong practices and what's working maybe we need to scale those up things that are really could shine a light on places where we are doing well but also shine a light on the things that are not and have the courage to say that's not working so I think I think we're going to have some really courageous conversations as a result of this and I'm grateful for that I think that's a step in the right direction for transformation is to just be thoughtful and to be honest with ourselves and to have the ability to to take a look at our data and have this conversation in a way that helps us to know I said the yesterday is to fail forward I don't want to use it as a way to just like you know it's not about beating people up or where we are but really to help us really really be in this continuous loop to say I had a lot of doing it that way or

[01:02:00]
now I'm thinking about doing this way so I just I'm just really hopeful about where we can head with the conversations and actually see changes see glimmers of Hope and hopefully see big changes too as a result of that and everybody coming into agreement with some of the strategies that we need to adopt you know district-wide or also learning the things that we don't need to adopt district-wide but we need to keep in certain parts of our community because it's the right activity for a particular community in their needs and it's right size or if it's it's appropriate in the way that we're doing it for some communities so I think there's going to be some aha moments and there's going to be some painful moments through this process but I think it'll be helpful to have those all right anything else no just on that topic of tone

[01:03:00]
yes I get a sense of urgency And yet when I talk to parents and students and teachers at schools I'm reminded that I have to be careful about how I I communicate that urgency I have to tone it down because there is it's a very layered conversation children are listening adults who are invested in those children and in those communities are listening and we need to be very layered and respectful of of their reality Nobody Does this job or the money and and parents and that's what little time and and

[01:04:00]
money they can some parents have more to invest I think we just need to be aware that and I say this for myself my children were part of that 20% they were not part of the 80% that was my reality and so again just our tone as we address urgency have has to be respectful and curious more than anything else we just have to be curious and and suspend judgment suspend what I think I know or what I know I know but maybe there's another perspective that I'm I'm missing and and that's why I think the family engagement the community engagement piece is so important thank you

[01:05:00]
any others that will move on to our next item which is special issues and this is an update on the right sizing Discussion Group board vice president Tampa Florida so we had our and I'm going to start going right now the right thing discussion group we met on Monday June 12th and what we were looking at was that this fiscal impact of moving students from La Luz to nearby schools and then renting the facility to the Albuquerque Sign Language Academy we also analyze the impact of turning Corrales in schools and figuring out that Financial impact of converting them from elementary school kids schools which is a little bit trickier than than we thought it would be so if adding six and eight

[01:06:00]
go to elementary schools keeps middle school students from leaving the district it's possible that the cost could end up being neutral or even save the district some money it was important that they said that we know that the SVG sdg is not going to cover all the expenses so in addition to talking about fiscal impacts we also discussed as you heard tonight about turning around us into an Early Childhood Center so as far as la Luz their FY 2500 was 1.8 million so the savings with that is going to be approximately 1.5 million and that will continue as I understood it'll continue every year that that's what the savings will be on the lease revenue from the Albuquerque Sign Language Academy will be 103 to 22200 and that would be based on enrollment all they have to use or transfer to other school

[01:07:00]
Bulls and the grants and capital funding will is redistributed to other schools and the utilities are about 40,000 and when it comes to maintenance and Landscaping that APS will do that's going to be billed to the Charter as far as Corrales about 30 Corrales we are told kids left at Mid school and we were told about 18 of those 30 went to Taylor so then that means about 12 students left APS from fifth grade and they went to other middle schools for sixth grade as far as the Corrales K-8 in the 5th Year of existence they will be about a million dollars in the red and we heard that there will be lower costs in court of Corrales in it John because the sixth graders will continue operating in the elementary model so there will only be elected for 7th and 8th graders so that's where we'll have some savings

[01:08:00]
there will be increased cost incurred as they will be paying the principal at a middle school level so in order to save the district money we need to be able to at Corrales recruit or retain 210 students by FY 30 so but if we don't if we don't do anything we won't realize a finding financial gain so we're just hoping that with the retention and recruitment of more students that there will be some financial gain by 2030 as far as Janet Khan very similar to Corrales they have increased costs because they're going to operate middle school with 6 7th and 8th graders so those they will have electives they will also be paying at a middle school principal salary will likely keep operating in the red but to save District money

[01:09:00]
they would need to recruit or retain about 195 students by FY 30 so that is the hope when it came to a lot of people obviously interested in the Middle School redesign so the Middle School task force already is working on this I'm trying to make middle schools more attractive and welcoming to students and families just so they're looking at transition time from elementary to Mid from mid to high if it's flexible sketching scheduling project-based learning more supports with counselors nurses Community School coordinators and more Peterson pointed out you shouldn't just have rigor just for rigor sake it should be more engaging and enriching and then one of the last things that we talked about is the Tyrannosaurus Early Childhood Center which you heard a lot about

[01:10:00]
and the board did vote to to approve the Esser funds for it'll be end up being about $900,000 just to get that design going and then they'll be spending about 30 million to refurbish some of the schools that are going to be affected by the right sizing and we also heard tonight that'll probably be approximately 60 million if it does end up getting billed to build that around as Early Childhood Hub I know some of the things that were pointed out is that you know there are not that many students under the age of five you know in the entire North Valley as we're continuing to lose population we also there was pointed out the the interim goal they were going to be concentrating on his more about kindergarten Readiness not Pre-K ready nest and then

[01:11:00]
pointed out that the Early Childhood Hub was a pilot and that maybe have been the wrong word because there isn't a time frame and know how are you measuring success and what happens if it doesn't draw the children that we hope will be up to 300 up to 300 kids the Pre-K funds were pointed out at fund at 10,000 per Pre-K students in APS only applied for this coming year for 4 year olds and that was for over 1300 students and the possibility was put out there that they may apply for three year olds next year which scared the heck out of me and we were told that there is about 800 private and Community providers I personally think that there's more than that but that's the number that we were given their was question is why expand when there are so many vacancies on

[01:12:00]
are you feeling what we have and if that funding that was requested was just in anticipation of expansion and was pointed out that private provider numbers are down and when they're down there not allowed to expand and another question was if APS reverted any funds back to the state for the vacancies which I was we were told that they didn't and put another question is why I expand Pre-K when you have vacancies and if Transportation won't be provided we know that that's often such an impediment to attendance for many of our families there was questions raised about whether this was the best use of our under enrolled schools and whether there's really a need or demand for the Early Childhood hubs and then we also heard about the Early Childhood design committee that consists of 13 members were hoping that's going to be more six were from APS one from the city one from County one from UNM one from CNN

[01:13:00]
from ydi and only two private so as was pointed out the majority of the committee our government staff so he asked that more community-based providers were included and as far as future topics are still going to be dual language Pathways the possibility of Coronado becoming a K-8 school with older students attending at a repurpose Taft with the understanding that we are going to most certainly I hope listen to the current concerns from Washington Middle School staff and that Community we expect many more conversations about Early Childhood centers about other boundary changes and CTE as we continue our work the next right thing discussion group meeting has yet to be scheduled so that's it thank you board member any questions so thank you for that right so our next item for discussion is

[01:14:00]
just a report on the superintendent search so just an update for the board on where we are we began I began talking about the search for our successor for superintendent Elder whose contract ends at the end of June 30th 2024 met with the executive committee so board members Jackson and board member and we had a conversation and we began to look at revising and reviewing and revising the scope of work for search and recruitment Services what we did is we just looked at a previous RFP and description that we have and we're working on that and the goal there is to have this done so that we can share what we have give it on to the rest of the board who will be reviewed who will be included in reviewing the recommended recommended changes and recommendations will bring that and hopefully we can find a place that on July 19th at our at our meeting then

[01:15:00]
and then we can get it posted for we can have it posted for request for proposals we hope to have that request for proposals at least for a month and have someone identified by the end of August so that's what we're moving on there in addition to this working with board with our board administrator Joanna Soh Johanna King on our budget and our timeline so that we can work on that started a draft timeline with the executive committee and again we'll have that that we can bring together to the whole board so that we can finalize some of the dates on that it was a good conversation so we're trying to to put all of our time together here so that we can and what our goal is here essentially is just like working back is that hopefully we could have a successor because I know I'm listening to I'm watching the papers out there is hoping that we could have a successor

[01:16:00]
working backwards from that by the spring I'm not going to say when what month but by the spring so that way there's plenty of time there for some transition with the current staff to the new to the new superintendent as we move forward in the meantime the other thing that we have to do is a board we have to work on revising the superintendent's job description there is one so that we can ensure that it focuses on student outcomes and aligns with the district schools and guardrails and the priorities around the Strategic plans so we do have an old description that will also share with the rest of the board we're reaching out to do some research and seek assistance from our partners at the council great City schools and other large Urban school districts that have superintendent job descriptions

[01:17:00]
that had been created under the sosg pieces and see how that's how that could be aligned and maybe included as well as part of our description so that's another piece that we can work on and we will send that out to the board which will also be receiving for me I sent it off to Joanna's there's the council great City schools has a pretty nice timeline and some of the Key activities that we need to do the key questions we need to ask ourselves so I'll be sending that out to the board too so that they'll be those key questions that you can ask and then will all come together and we can work on making sure that we've addressed everyone's concerns as we're moving forward and we've got the piece of that we need to have so that we can get this done what's really exciting about this is that we have lots of time we have some time to get our stuff together with the goal in the middle here of going out you know once we have a search firm who can assist us will assist us with key things like the community engagement piece

[01:18:00]
on how we go out listen to the community in terms of what are the key when I was saying what what you know what their what their expectations are and what they would like to see in this process or giving us an input in terms of the qualities and the qualifications for a superintendent will be synthesizing all that information obviously one of the things that I'd like to consider and and I think we just need to talk about that as a board to and with our search for when they come in is like do we have another broader committee that is also working with us on this and it's not just just the board but that we also have some community members that may be are working with us on this process so I think once we have a search firm we can talk to them about those processes and how or whatever they propose to us in terms of of their proposal to us in terms of how they'd like to work with us we always have to get some interview questions all

[01:19:00]
design and all that but again once we have a search firm that helps us with that process also built into our timeline is taking into the account that we're going to have some new board members as a result of the election and trying to build in some time before the board is actually the new board members are actually sworn in but have an opportunity with them to bring them up to speed in terms of where we are in the process so that way they can hit the ground running obviously looking at the selection and and the interviewing process with the superintendent occurring just immediately after after the election in the new board would take on on that responsibility so so just making sure that there's time built in there for the new board members as they're getting oriented to the district but they're also getting oriented to the process so let's see what else am I have on here I just want to add that

[01:20:00]
really committed to making this process is transparent as possible there's more to come we want to make sure that the community is engaged and you know it's it's the great conversation now is like what do we want to have moving forward and it's a good opportunity for us for the board to work with the community as we kind of step forward into this next into this next step so that we can make this transition as smooth as possible and as positive as possible and so there's a lot of anticipation I know from the media in terms of what we going to do and how are we going to do it and so hopefully you will start to hear from each of our meetings that this will be a regular conversation as well and a topic so that we can make sure that we're just being as transparent as possible with the community in terms of where we are in the process and the steps that we're taking oh I do want to add that on that RFP and this is for the board

[01:21:00]
did have a chance to talk with Miss Apodaca what will do on that is I'm going to have the executive committee beyond the RFP committee on that so the executive committee will review the proposals that we have and then there will be a presentation made to the board very similar to what the staff does in terms of here's who appears the scores and we'll present those to the board about what the selection is on there hopefully we get you know several proposals so that we have a way to sort of look through that way through a search from that can help us in the best way possible so I will stop there and ask for any questions additional thoughts things we need to think about what's important and we're just beginning so I mean I think it's for the community is just work just beginning the process and

[01:22:00]
I'm hopeful that once we can get a search firm you know helping with us on this process they'll they'll really sort of guide us more through the process and take us through that so that's the hardest part is just getting to that point so all right I have one question that's its related but so during this next year I would assume superintendent Elders probably going to be using some time and you know exhausting some of that that would he has left so has it been decided who is going to build that in the meantime not yet I did talk to superintendent Elder about that just right after and he is an announcement of some reorganization so that's going to be coming next and having some conversation in terms of when that's going to occur and how that transition that time line will will occur in terms of when he'll be backing off of guess you could say

[01:23:00]
taking some time off but right now at this point he's he's on and so we haven't had we haven't had that finalized just yet has he started using any of his leave yet he's just using time here and there I mean he's taking like a couple of days of vacation but he doesn't have anything announced in terms of like a length of time that he's going to be taking off okay but I'm sure once we get to that point we'll announce that much you all know any other questions about this absence tonight and I just didn't know we were already no no no no no no he is still on I think he's at a conference yeah so no no no no no he's he's still working any other comments questions all right okay the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday July 19th 2023 at 5 p.m. and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday June 28th

[01:24:00]
2023 at 5:15 p.m. or immediately following the finance committee meeting both will be held in the John Milner Community boardroom of the Allison Bruce King educational complex and live stream on aps.edu so our next item is consideration for the Board of Education to convene an executive session is authorized by the public meetings act section 10 - 15 - 1 H5 to discuss collective bargaining do I have a motion okay I move to convene to Executive session as authorized by the public meetings act section 1015 dash 1 186th

[01:25:00]
Yolanda Monterey Cordova yes all right so now we'll just ask for all the folks that are not part of
