[00:06:00]
I just said it stinks being first but I'm going to do it Montoya Court of a superintendent Elder members of the board my name is Theresa Elgin I'm a teacher at West Mesa High School I love West Mesa High School from the moment that I started working there I knew I was meant to be there I want to retire from West Mesa High School it is where I'm supposed to be but with each passing day it is becoming more difficult for me to justify State safe on campus on account of all the guns making their way onto my school campus school campuses are gun free zones but apparently not at West Mesa do I need to be put into a position where I'm risking my life and brain that I have heavily invested in to do the

[00:07:00]
dog that I love I really want to be at West Mesa teaching the students that I am meant to be there for him from the bottom of my heart but I do not want to fear for my safety or the safety of my fellow staff members or the safety of the students that I teach in order to do my job properly our staff is traumatized by the reoccurring lockdowns in incidents of guns on campus we are not able to do our jobs effectively at this point this problem should not be allowed to escalate to the point where one or more of us have to be injured or lose their lives because nothing has been done I hope that the district steps in and provides at minimum more Security on campus we need more security we no longer need excuses I also hope that along this process students and parents are able to find their voice to demand the right to a safe learning environment

[00:08:00]
thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is I believe it's Raquel mwandi and after her will be Chadron Kidwell and you can go ahead and run over here if you'd like 2 minutes to everyone in the room this is my first time that I wanted to bring a cross one of them is creating a school for you coming to students or a Learning Hub we have a deficiency when it comes to like new population because there is a little learning English skills like Reading Writing and all that stuff and having a hub for the students who just come in the US and no no no no no anything about the culture here would be something great this will make it will create

[00:09:00]
a culture sensitive environment for these students were just trying to assimilate here and it will make an easy transition for students into APS education system another thing that I wanted to say a lot of immigrants or new comma students that come into the aps some of them do have education backgrounds from where they come from and do have high math skills and then when we come here we're pushed back to take like ESL classes classes and one thing I would like to suggest is like when students are being assessed for these moles of stuff like that they could be connected to the CTE or the Career Technical education or other things that could help them build a career for themselves because we have a lot a high number of students who don't go for secondary education or go to or even graduate from high school because of these things and the other thing that I would like to suggest is that having grad students who have graduated like myself here I'm an African immigrant

[00:10:00]
do you like having students who have graduated from abso parents who can speak both English and their native language come back into APS teach some of these children on their first language is cuz if someone can easily understand their first language they can read and write it it would make it very easy for them to learn a different language I think another thing I would like to say I myself when it comes to the point of having a Learning Hub I did not go to my school district I went to Highland because I found it a community where I found safe and I had like more people who knew exactly where I was coming from and stuff like that and that made it easy for me to to us through my education and another thing is make Rachel Rachel have to stop you it's over two minutes when I need you to one in one sentence you want you can say one sentence and wrap everything up real quickly one thing I would like to add is like please provide transportation for these students who do not live in districts where their schools are that's the last point Thank You Ma'am our next speaker is

[00:11:00]
well and after that will be Eric boerger good evening and I'm here to speak to the district's plan for Taft middle school to become a dual language magnet for the benefit of the Coronado students as laid out in the journal reporting last week there are multiple flaws with this plan number one the Coronado families already have a dual language Middle School less than a mile up the road it's at Washington it is 50 years strong and it has plenty of capacity for any of the Coronado students who want to attend number two the Coronado family they do not make use of the existing programs at Washington or Truman or Hayes when my daughter promoted from Coronado in 2015 she was one of 25% of the kids in her class who went on to dual language middle school and when little sister promoted in 2019 the number was down

[00:12:00]
to 10% number three in the event that all of the Coronado fifth graders suddenly want to make use of Taft the enrollment at Coronado is capped at $300 they only promote about 55th graders a year so the maximum enrollment from Coronado at Taft would be about $150 kids that will not begin to make use of that building number for where is APS planning on getting the Dual language staff for this additional program certified language teachers are in very short supply from the existing programs at Hayes at truman at Washington and has any thought been to the negative impact that that's going to have on those programs that are already up and running at anybody from the executive office or from this committee about language schools around downtown

[00:13:00]
Coronado to ask what they thought of this plan because it's a bad plan and I might be one of the first people to come and speak to you about it but if the district pushes forward with it I guarantee you I will not be the last person so I'm respectfully asking you to reconsider do not move forward with a plan to turn Taft into a dual language Middle School that the district does not really need just a minute thank you again so high school where I've been teaching since the 2004 2005 school year I'm also a former High School thus I have a very personal invested interest in the safety of our students and staff I'm appealing to you all to do more to address out of school boundaries

[00:14:00]
call involving guns and students possession all within the time span of less than one year recently a gun even went off inside one of our classrooms that was full of students luckily no one was injured but how long can APS go until it really serious tragedy strikes no one knows the answer for sure but we may be on borrowed time as such I implore you to do all you can to prevent future instances of gun violence on our APS campuses please refocus on appropriate and immediate consequences for students found to be in possession of a gun on school grounds we need to have tough discipline in our schools in recent years I suggest that discipline has been curtail as a result what we've seen is an increase in problematic behaviors that make it harder to maintain a safe academic environment federal gun is to be expelled for no less than one year from what I've seen in official documents and heard from many colleges within the district APS is not following the law with the deity and if this is true the school district could and should have Federal

[00:15:00]
appropriate consistent discipline across the board I wonder can you insure our school communities at the school board the district is doing everything you can to give school officials a power to ensure that our schools are safe I'd also like to strongly advocate for higher pay for our security Personnel our security Personnel should be paying them out that is commensurate with the enormity of their responsibilities which is protecting the health and safety of everyone at their School site and the educational sphere the most precious capital is the people that population is schools the staff and the students our security and they're underpaid and it is time we look into making Investments by increasing pay and their numbers last week there's been a lot of talk recently about retaining students and attractors wouldn't it make sense to make sure that our schools are safe as they possibly can beat to attract and retain students and staff thank you very much thank you sir our next speaker is I believe

[00:16:00]
is Kris or Creasey yasi Gonzalez did I say it right thank you and our next speaker after is Laura Vickers 2 minutes when you begin speaking okay my name is Carissa Gonzalez I'm also out of West Mesa High School and I'm coming before you today to address our gun violence issue on our campuses I haven't been working with education for me many years from Colorado to Seattle to here and I'm new here I'm only been here for a couple of months but I'm also one of the families that are all so their part of the Eva team but I'm standing before you you know reading some of the school board Mission and goal setting division goals for the district and hanging the student experience and the main function of a school board is so what ensure the best possible education experience for our students but it's been a struggle at her school and I wanted to share some of the research facts so you have a deep understanding what

[00:17:00]
dealing with on hands like Ground Zero type of thing so the most comprehensive analysis to date of American children who experienced gun violence at schools find that they have higher rates of school absenteeism Laura high school and college graduate rates they earn lower incomes by their mid-twenties on average shooting exposed students will most likely experience these statistics and statistics already are stacked against our kids you know and the study was done by the NBA are so working paper you know co-authored by Maya professor of medicine students at schools were shooting occurred incidents in which a gun is fired but no one's physically hurt or injured or killed but they faced lasting negative consequences as mentioned earlier about which is all the statistics and a lot of our Educators have to do with that and the results show that the adversity is universal cutting across race at Disney Junior Associates and it also shows that children exposed to these shootings they all experience

[00:18:00]
massive disruption disruptions in their learning and later economic well-being and when their school shooting you just don't have one child in a classroom now you have an entire classroom trauma affected children that's what we've been dealing with and research shows that policy discussions about the cost of gun violence and not only focus on fatalities but also account for the large cost of exposure to violence on children's long-term educational economic trajectories Gonzales I'm sorry I have to stop you please repeat that quickly and I just want to leave you with what my students have expressed to me in one school because the potential weapons and I have another kid that says I don't think our teachers know what to do in a situation where there is a web and I don't trust him with my life These are kids that we talked to consistently every single day thank you ma'am thank you next up is Laura Vickers two minutes

[00:19:00]
can you begin speaking hello my name is Laura Baker and I work at West Mesa High School I've been there for about 4 years now and this is my 26th year of teaching I've never seen it this bad and I have experienced guns on campus but I would like you to read you some of the words that my students wrote today about gun violence it should not be scared to go to school having to think what's going to happen or if there's anything bad coming our way when we go to school today is absolutely terrible for not only our minds before our friends and family and Missy said that there's a lot of traumatized kids there there's a lot of traumatized staff there and I found out that I did have one of those kids in my classes I'm traumatized okay and it's very hard to teach when you're when you're thinking what's going to happen next and some kid goes by and says yeah have a nice

[00:20:00]
stay like that we need more security guards we lost one of our good security guards and the other security guards due to covid they took them away and they never replaced them and here we are with over $1,500 kids and three security guards and an Administration that can't control it because their hands are tied with just about everything so I'm hoping that this board decides to get us some security guards before something else happens because I don't want to die before I retire and I'm ready to retire soon I'd like to retire a life that's all I got to say thank you man or next speaker is America hi everyone

[00:21:00]
and I work with United vs for new cameras I'm here about the strategic planning for APS and I can see a lot of questions here I want to raise I want to ask the board member to delay voting for The strategic planning because a lot of newcomer families didn't get the chance to participate on these sessions that were provided to them due to work some of them they couldn't get the chance to participate in the survey because it was provided in English and Spanish and it was posted on APS website and then when it was translated it was translated like in a short time I couldn't really participate and giving it to them I really do like request the board members to delay and give them a chance to participate because I feel that they are ignored and their voices are not being hurt completely and also I want to I want to support my point by finding

[00:22:00]
how many newcomer families do we have here at APS how many newcomer statues do we have I couldn't find this information anywhere I don't know if this is something like APS should have on their website or is it like secret to have that information so I really request that maybe we can have some data about this we can't really help when you come out families or their students to flourish and succeed if we cannot really track them and see who's the graduated how many do we have enrolled in the schools how many are dropping out on the body is of language barrier here we have it's always an issue and I think we need to give them a second chance so that's what I want to say and thank you for all the work you do I can't see all these questions here one more last point this was very hard for our newcomer families they if they cannot really access information in their own language they cannot understand what's going on and then in the aps system here they can come from a different background they

[00:23:00]
have a different knowledge about how they work that and their countries but not in here so I don't know how can we help them but I think we can work together to help them understand or at least find a way to translate the information of the website so when they can log in they can find out information it's always our like as a community leader we help a lot I have to stop can you please wrap up very quickly so we always have to reach out to them to give them all information and the language they understand I hope that we can solve this problem and find a solution to it thank you next speaker is on zoom and it's Alyssa or tarot you have two minutes starting now thank you good evening my name is Elizabeth Taylor and I am West Mason's teacher of the year for 2022 I'm here today to bring light to a dark subject that we have become too familiar with violence and gun

[00:24:00]
in April of 2022 a student was shot and killed 5 ft from where students were about to partake in PE that will be the end of that we all said this loss of life brought new people to our campus and we all side with some sense of relief that this would bring awareness and get us the help we desperately needed 9 months later and the media the camera Crews and the higher-ups of APs have all left but that one thing that sparked their attention in the first place remained guns we've had numerous confirmed incidents with loaded weapons on campus since then the staff and students of West Mesa stand in front of you with desperation in her eyes asking you to help us give these children a safer place to attend school we are asking the people we've elected to fight for us to fight with us we hope that you will come together with West Mesa High School to bring real solutions to the table in order to prevent guns from continuing to come on to our campus we need action and we urgently need it now most children at West Mesa have never had an adult fight for them but that's changing today we are Relentless and we will not stop until they feel safe after all we are West Mesa thank you

[00:25:00]
our next speaker is Joseph Bauer Mr hold on we have a problem give me one minute I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I was saying problem is but Washington Middle School and West Mesa High School

[00:26:00]
2 hours last school year I work at West Mesa and we have had five guns confiscated sent Andrew person was murdered with a fully automatic pistol being found on a student just last week but this doesn't make it personal for you so ask each of you this question these questions if you knew that teenagers were carrying concealed firearms every day at your work house safe would you feel would you think about quitting your job or moving to another state could you blame any of your colleagues who quit because of this or any students who decide not to come back to our schools because of this now you know the situation that is facing APS are Educators and our students every single day please start getting involved in this situation thank you thank you Mr Bauer our next speaker is Monica

[00:27:00]
what was me you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking man hi Montoya Cordova superintendent Elder and board members my name is Monica Oglesby and I'm the librarian at West Mesa High School every day when I get to work I go around the entire library and I check all the four entry points to make sure that those doors are locked just in case we go into a lockdown anytime intercom goes off randomly throughout the day which happens to the front door to lock the door because I'm pretty sure we're going into a lockdown there have been far too many dangerous situations at West Mesa this past year and they are becoming all too common I don't feel safe the problem is there are guns on campus students report that the others probably have guns on them more than is being reported West Mesa has almost 1800 students but only one APS police officer and three security officers it is not enough stunts behaviors

[00:28:00]
more extreme and volatile than they have ever been before but consequences for these actions are being withheld students are desperately trying to find boundaries and as a school district We are failing them they need consequences for their actions students need to feel safe at school how much has been spent on social emotional learning for students this past year I'm guessing a lot of money however students will continue to not feel safe if there are guns on campus we need to ensure the school is gun free there's the 1994 guns free act which states that that if we are going to keep getting Federal money we need to ensure that students are being expelled for a full calendar year I don't believe that's happening we need more security officers we need consequences for problematic student behaviors we need help everyone should feel safe at school what is the teachers are meeting again this Friday during lunch at 12

[00:29:00]
clock in the library I invite all of you guys to come and be a part of the solution so that we can work towards it to make it a safe place thank you thank you ma'am for next speaker is Isaac penalty believe you have two minutes once you begin speaking Sir Mr Elder and members of the board thank you for your time this evening my name is Isaac penalty and I've been a teacher at West Mesa High School for over a decade I'm here this evening for the same reason I come to work each day which is to provide the further good public good through service to the students of our district for whom it is my privilege to serve the specific concern I bring regards an issue known across our country State and Community regarding the growing instances of violence or Preparation to meet violence through the possession of carrying a firearms in public Spaces by minors my school has been hosted numerous and highly publicized instances of these incidents in recent years and while my instinct is to determine if our campus is

[00:30:00]
repent with other schools in APS it is surprisingly difficult to locate accurate information on the location and frequency of such events what standards of school population size or history of gun or other weapons related incidents are required before a school can be eligible for greater security or proactive interventions we know that the fences that were erected after Washington Middle School demonstrates the district's willingness to do something to increase student security it is no mystery that a larger number of weapons related incidents drives the very same insecurities that leads even more students to bring weapons on campus it is imperative that we devise and Implement a transparent way to quantify and make eligible schools with greater security needs so that our students can have a level of security at their schools that will begin to restore the

[00:31:00]
sense of security needed for our students to learn grow and flourish I am here voluntarily because my students tell me they are insecure about coming daily to a place that they are by law required to attend and at which they deserve to feel secure thank you thank you sir our next speaker hello thank you for seeing us my name is Lincoln from West Mesa High School Fine Arts Teacher I've been teaching for APS for 24 years my first year was 1999 April was calling back there has not been any real changes since 1999 across this country every time I walk into a new classroom

[00:32:00]
my first response is all right where do I get to put my kids what do I got to do to keep my kids safe how do I lock things down what else do I got to do in the hallway what kids do I got to get in here before I can lock down completely I can't even imagine to tell you what it's like to do that in every classroom that I've been in every one of your classrooms that I have taught in for 24 years not much has changed in 24 years at the moment me and my colleagues are reacting because of what you've heard of what's happened in the last year in a little bit longer what I want to know is it possible for APS for you to be proactive instead of reactive can you make changes that will prevent another tragedy

[00:33:00]
will you thank you thank you man or next speaker is on zoom and it is Kaylee or Kylie Patty's are you there hey there my name my name is Google so I would hope that you would listen to what the elders in the room are speaking my name is Kaylee and I'm a special education and ELD teacher at West Mesa High School I have been an APS classroom teacher for over 20 years and I have seen enough I am demanding change to ensure the safety of all stakeholders at West Mesa we had a student death last year and we were not giving any additional security

[00:34:00]
enforcements the student that brought the gun to school that went off in the woods class before Christmas break was one of my students I never thought I would see this day as a teacher when is enough enough we have one armed officer who was amazing and for administrators who are also amazing and almost 2,000 students is that even logical West Mason needs attention and it needs it fast I would love for you to come to my class and talk to my students and hear their voices their voice should be the loudest as a special education teacher I am always teaching my students to advocate for themselves well I am advocating for them because they do not have a voice in this situation I am asking that you the board do something about this I'm asking that you come to our school I'm asking that you meet with us I'm asking that you hear her voice because I can guarantee you what happened in Virginia

[00:35:00]
when the student taught the teacher will happen it's just a matter of when and when it does happen somebody's going to have to be held responsible thank you and go West Mesa thank you ma'am and our next speaker is Rachel if 2 minutes on YouTube my entire life and I've always been a supporter of Educators I am friends with many teachers at West Mesa and it makes me scared to think about losing one of my friends do not belong on school campuses I want you to I want you to increase security at West Mesa to protect my

[00:37:00]
play 5th 2023 policy items do I have a motion so move this is Danielle I'll send you know it may have a roll call please I need Aragon Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson crystal is consideration for approval of the January 18th 2023 Ford of Education meeting items these are all so consent items do I have a motion some moved Josefina I'll just call me later on Danielle Gonzales Peterson Crystal for discussion in action is consideration for

[00:38:00]
Google is student outcomes focused goals we're going to have a discussion and action on this before I go to a motion on the on the items that are up for consideration these are the goals I think what I'll do first is I said I'm trying to think on this one because I know I would like to amend some of the language on that and so I think what I'd like to do is just propose some of the Amendments that I'd like to make to some of those the goals in terms of how I would like to one of the things I was thinking is on the first goal instead of the language that we have I'd like to propose the percentage of third grade students from student groups named in the Yazzie Martinez joint settlement plus the African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above on the state English language arts

[00:39:00]
do you have assessment and I was safe from EX on May 20th 23rd through X on May 2028 so that we don't set that metric but in parents say the metric to be determined upon receipt of the 2023 results from the state but shall not be less than a total of 10 point increase over five years so I agree with that proposed change with the exception of Mexico any other discussion on that could you read could you read that language again sure and this time the percentage of third grade students from student groups named in the Yazzie Martinez joint settlement plus African-American students who demonstrate grade

[00:40:00]
level proficiency or above on the state English language arts summative assessment from X on May 2023 through why on May 2028 and in parentheses to be determined upon receipt of the 2023 results from the state but shall not be less than a total of 10 point increase over five years thank you and this is just adding that clarification on that I think when we were discussing it last week we were just unclear on that and I really liked changing from subgroups to saying students I don't think our students are subgroups their students so and this was just we can set that that bench based on on what we actually get in 2023 so that we know the pointed you know the point that we're going to be working with there but it wouldn't be less than

[00:41:00]
go to 10 point increase over 5 years so if we are increasing greater than that good for us but I'd like for us to have that metric that comes in from the state exam do we well sorry about that may I just go ahead I have two questions in in the week since this was discussed or were we able to determine what that metric actually is with that proficiency rate actually is Scott well we could make some projections based on old data pre-pandemic but we were not so what we had been told from Council was he wanted to wait for they suggest we wait for this assessment to do that what I heard last week was that you were proposing 16% that's not an unreasonable number in the scheme of things

[00:42:00]
you were obviously proposing 10% simply because it seemed like we were picking a number I was I think 10% is as we said last week the minimum and we can only work on that we would like to see some Trend data but you guys want numbers so I am concerned about the projection on the prior data because the conditions are pretty significantly different for our students today as they were pre-pandemic and that's that's where we're at but there was a proposal last week somewhere between 10 to 16% and on the literacy of that I don't think we were bothered a lot by that number and I think you know just in the conversation that I had with Ashley to with great City Schools is that we don't sort of box ourselves in either because we don't want to get in trouble like some other

[00:43:00]
it doesn't make a lot of sense in the way that the that the proficiency goal was actually stated this one adds more clarity and we're very specific but we're going to start at X yeah sorry that's my question is do we have no X would not be determined until May 2023 when that state summative when the when the summative assessment is in because that's what we're waiting for but we do state that we will not be less than 10 points over on you know over the five five years so we're just waiting for that metric so that we can show that growth going because what if it comes in at 20 I'm just I'm just I'm just picking a number but what if it comes in at 20 and we can show the growth over time that way so I really would just like for us to have that metric at the beginning point so that we can show it over

[00:44:00]
I completely agree I think we need to have an actual metric in there I just thought that over the week since we had the data last week but the data was based on the entirety of our students that we would have been able to kind of decipher what that X is no because the difficulty is this the old data is a different tests so not only are we using data from a time that is no longer current condition but we're trying to apply a test that doesn't mean there's some correlation we can make a projection we can make correlations it's they can do that what's your name is could we do we have the Martinez numbers of sussed out yet and I don't believe we have it completely worked out because so many of those subgroups are mixed so they're still working on that that was my question okay sorry you have the TV

[00:45:00]
I was wondering if it had been pulled out yet what you had last week was the the groups that fall into those group the numbers for those groups but those groups oftentimes have crossover so we were suggesting if as we move forward to look specifically at the Ozzie Martinez subgroups that we break that out so you got a pure group of this is this and that's how that Richard and the researchers were suggested that's what they're still working on just the last thing is I just want to and I know that I'll get out voted on this but I do want to reiterate that I do think it's very important that the overall student outcome goal addresses all of our children and that the specificity comes in the interim goals I just I have to say that again I think that the goal for the entire District should address all of our kids and it should say the entire

[00:46:00]
specific specific groups are given a heavier Focus but I just I wish that the overall student outcome goal addressed all of our students so that's my thought you have any discussions on goal too so it would be the same the percentage of eighth grade students from groups from student groups named in the Yazi Martinez settlement plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above on the state maps summative assessment will increase from X on May 2023 to why on May 20th and the metric to be determined upon receipt of the 2023 results from the

[00:47:00]
but shall not be less than a total of 10 point increase over 5 years 10% Point increase 10 point increase yeah 10.00 and then I think we have some discussion on the third goal that superintendent Elder you had some news on that one for us I think we all received that I don't know if there was any questions about where we are on that with the with the board there's a proposal to delay that action on the third goal because we're still working out the metrics for that because we haven't the the district just having some difficulty just figuring out a way to actually measure that we just need to be very very

[00:48:00]
write the email I sent you all today after the reworking of the the goal last week we went back and started playing with with how that would look and we began to realize there were some concerns when we initially proposed 3 to 4 year completers and then moved to 2 your completed is it really changes quite a few of the items and actually it really revolved a little bit but remember Gonzalez around your question about Athletics and the evidence-based program because then we began to look at okay so what does 2 years of art for example bring into Netflix we start providing in terms of college or career Readiness right and I think there's arguments to be made there as far as creative thinking discipline all the lot of the the the the the the values and the habits are developed but when we set down

[00:49:00]
did our original scan we discovered that we have over 2900 potential courses that qualify from the list we generated and if you square that you end up a little over 8 million and then half of that cuz it's two classes it's 4 million permutations so we would have about $20,000 variations for a kid that they could potentially take and I just don't really see school staff being able to work work through that so we recognized it hadn't quite worked out the way we had in anticipated or intended and so we're asking that you consider a table and we will either rework it with a more limited menu or propose something else along with the seal goal just because even with that one we were really bad so we could track grades but it's a lot of great tracks so just that was our there's some logistical and

[00:50:00]
I think it moved away from what we originally had envisioned and I think some of the conversation you guys got to send to help to clarify that for us that's why we're doing this work is to be able to get down to that granular level and sort of think about how we want to make sure that these goals are articulate well and that they can be measured over time and there are things that we really could really use to express how the district is making movement in those areas and so to have a bad goal or to have something that's really not well measured could potentially just cause us some problems in the in the future and and then with the coaching that you know with the council a great City Schools wanting us to be really clear on making sure that that goal works not you know not only for our students and family so that it can be really clear to them about how that metric would work on their behalf but also just

[00:51:00]
sure that we have the right level of District support and staff in the way that we can measure that so that we can be truly transparent I think with the community about where we're going and how we're reaching that goal and it's not different from year one to your two to year three so we've got to be really really clear on that go ahead did you have I heard it would be helpful to talk through what are the parameters that you're working with to be able to narrow in there and so considering that this is a post-secondary Readiness goal and I was pushing for evidence based on what shows that kids are college career military ready and so we do know that that exists so you know definitely keeping API b c t e dual enrollment courses industry certification I'd be curious if we were to narrow it to that small

[00:52:00]
how what's your sense of where that would leave us in which case we'd be taking out ROTC fine arts arts that's sort of what we're saying we need to limit the list and so it's a matter of determining what on the list were limiting it so you are correct that we would need to bring that list down at the same time but we'd have to like I said we have to sit there and try to figure out what we can meet the requirements for what we are looking at is a post-secondary what this really sort of turned into was I think we talked about last year was an engagement we keeping students and maybe that's something I don't know but it's just it just sort of morphed on us so we're looking at what would be the specific classes that we think you know I think like the njrotc is something that a lot of kids really look to

[00:53:00]
I also have to say if we're going to try to grow I want to know how we're going to do that and what's our strategy to doing that so if you have two limited list like IB is a fairly small program we can take about 50 kids as my understanding per year that's not going to make a significant difference across the full District's different some other courses are different so I'm not saying we should count IB it's a wonderful program but impacting it at a district level I worry about limited us too much to me so I guess from my perspective as a board member and what I heard from the community was wanting to make sure that the kids are ready for post-secondary whatever that may be so college career or military so what do we as a district know about what our community needs to be ready for college career or military and so certainly it's what pathways are most aligned to living wages in

[00:54:00]
community and to the projections for what those wages are going to be and so my biggest concern was one making sure that they're ready but two not putting them into dead end careers through limited Pathways and so for me that's the other for lack of a better word guardrail or framework and so I think there needs to be some quality frame around that too culinary arts is great but that's kind of a dead end for the most part career you may have won five star chef and so my question really is sort of what is the data the research the information the framework that you might use superintendent Elder to narrow that down if it were up to you well I will say that the CT Department's under pretty major revision for example okay right now we have for comprehensive programs across the district and in all the community surveys what came back was the public really likes the fact that students in APS have a wide

[00:55:00]
city of options to choose from at the same token but this goal kind of says is maybe we need to limit that a little bit more so as far as CTE we're trying to work on programs of studies and develop them across schools it's not available everywhere and there's a lot of reasons for that sometimes it's that we just don't have teachers that are certified to do it sometimes it's because back when we are under Nick will be we were so busy converting shops to computer labs that we've lost some of the training centers that we could use for the trades work the other thing that we're working with is I can tell you is in the last week I had a very productive meeting with construction at 100 million dollars a year 60% of it goes out of state because that's only place they can find workers

[00:56:00]
we talked about the need for teachers we talked about the need for space we can talk about the need for equipment and I also talked about the need for some direction because I don't you mentioned culinary arts culinary arts is a really popular program kids love to learn to cook they learn to spend that time with their hands and doing that they love learning how to cater I agree a lot of kids it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's sort of but a lot of the other programs have gone away because we just haven't had the people or the space for it so how do we build those and that's what he's working on now how do we begin the process of rebuilding what was lost so will that be measured once we have some comprehensive program

[00:57:00]
which is phenomenal we talked about how do we expand that we have some ideas on how to expand that but again it calls with an investment of space and and then somebody's got to teach the course I also know that on the other side of it is that schools are also going towards like a work-based learning approach as well where it's not just about the horses that they're taking but also making sure that students have an opportunity to be engaged in a workplace learning environment where you know because one of the things that is demonstrated is that even students who have a summer job or have a job for even a period of time that there's a lot of learning that goes in that and a lot of preparedness to be able to get ready for the next level those students that engage in that kind of Peace have a lot more perseverance they they tend to to be more focused in their classroom work and it's it's also

[00:58:00]
another level of you know ability to be able to get in there and I know that APS has got a very small work-based learning component because it's I think there's a project that we have with the city that helps with some of the students and I'm wondering if and and board member gets all this I'm wondering if if we narrowed that list I'm not opposed to narrowing it to you know to the ones like the common pieces like AP CTE what else did we put in there I didn't even look like I don't have it right in front of me dual credit even like even the bilingual seal piece because I think those are all really important ones so if we limit it to those those things that we know I can industry certificate students that are earning that I think the data that we would get from that would also show where our gaps are because I think it could help us to understand where we might need to add more

[00:59:00]
cramming to really lift that up because there is you know there's going to be students that maybe are not fitting in that as well and why not you know there's a question I have is around rigor especially in South Valley schools and the number of like a PCS that are either not available or not taken because they just and I hear often as we can't feel the class and I'm like really you know it's like so I I'm not a post to having a short list like that with those things that are very specific on those things that are measured I think traditionally and other high schools and also our meaningful to like the workforce because industry recognized certificates you know dual Credit Associates degrees dual language all of those things are really incredibly important on the workforce in on the back end and I know from you know the Department of Workforce Solutions those are the things with even within our

[01:00:00]
Workforce Development work it's all based on that those are the things we're looking for especially that industry certificate opportunity the Dual Credit Associates Degree all of those pieces really demonstrate that Readiness if you will after after high school cuz it is preparedness for for Workforce or even to step into a post-secondary educational experience so I don't know where we go from here as I recall weird kind of trying to model off the Broward County goal which I pulled up again so it reads the percentage of graduates who earned any combination of two from the following list college credit on AP IV dual enrollment industry certification so I think that sort of the narrow list if we had bilingual that I think we could potentially come to agreement on tonight and maybe vote on tonight with the

[01:01:00]
whatever agreement that the specifics around the data are added later out there too and also to superintendent Elder with that proposal soap reading it like how it is I mean I think it has it except we have it is sequential elective courses we would just remove that right so it would be who earn please boards if you could help me just sort of look at that goal three the way that we have it written what would be an amendment that you haven't and I want to wait and and and and I will say there's no shame in us also just sort of postponing this till next week so that we can be real firm because we've got we've got a meeting next week to get our SEL

[01:02:00]
School climate goal really firmed up so maybe we could just pause you know put a pause in it just till next week it's just a week and go ahead yeah just to respond to the question I don't know that I would necessarily amend our language so much is start over with the start of new language around the percent of graduates who earned any combination of two from the following list taking out the sequential elective courses on an approved list okay for now so just as a point you're really on pretty much the same language we were on this afternoon when we were sort of trying to figure out I mean the AP the IB the Dual credit that seems to be consistent and then the bilingual certificate is so important in APS I really don't see how you ignored that my only concern and this was the other issue with the larger is then what are interim goals going to look like is it enrollment in those classes

[01:03:00]
what are we track what did Broward track because I looked at it and I don't remember but I am curious what the interim goals cuz we were struggling with the when it was huge we were really struggling what are they looking at and how do we impact that other than encouraging kids to enroll in those classes so I think the impact piece I think is where tuned could be really helpful on what are the inputs and I think Partnerships with industry Partnerships with Workforce Solutions to get a sense on what are the pathways that have living wages and how you could align to those with those Partnerships look like there could be input miles in place on that the interim goals that Broward has are the percent of minority students in Grade 9 through 12 or in any combination of two was one in her own goal the other room goal is the percent of ell students and then there are others percent of students for a classified as ese

[01:04:00]
I just think for the interests of like because we're missing two board members to and you know tonight and I and I just want to say our two board members that are missing tonight one is stuck in an airport somewhere and the other had like a personal family piece and so I mean generally we have a full day and I'm really sad that they're not here I would really like for us to just kind of put a pin I think we can get to this next week really easily and so let's put a pin in that one and if I could have you know we proposed some amended language for goal one and two and I think if we could agree with that I think we could move forward so I would be willing to entertain a motion to that effect so I'm actually going to jump in okay go ahead personally I believe it's important that we do make a decision tonight we've had several opportunities to be able to make adjustments edits as needed and we

[01:05:00]
I believe several people and even the audience are ready to hear what we're going to put out there for our students we could make some adjustments as we go through and have the superintendent and his team you know at his inputs and align it to something that's going to be that's going to work for his department but I do not feel comfortable in any way of tabling this I really think we need to make a solid decision and I'm not talking about the whole thing just tabling the third goal or I think we my opinion I believe we can adopt the third goal tonight and then still add to some of the language later with the superintendent in his cabinets input so I'd like to weigh in I think Precision I'm a stickler about precision and language and I think we have to get it right we have to know what we're dealing with I mean we

[01:06:00]
make a decision last week and now we're hearing that the consequence of that decision was 20,000 possibilities that's crazy I mean so words matter Precision matters and that's not what I was going to weigh in on but my concern is that we have not enough of our children get those jobs and I am bound and determined to this is our opportunity this third goal is our opportunity to get that right I'm tired of seeing how many new people move into the state for jobs that are attainable by our kids there's a man at CNM

[01:07:00]
who who is begging for robotics he's got a robotic certificate and he's a pipeline to Sandia Labs we need more discussion about that but I want to hear how we're going to get into that pipeline so I know we're eager to get this all done I don't think there is any shame or disgrace and giving us a little bit more time with this third goal and I'd really like to hear from our chief of schools go ahead I'm good evening Madam president members of the board and superintendent Elder we have gone back and forth as you can see we're doing it here as well with the word smithing of what this looks

[01:08:00]
do you like and the impact to not just our students but to our schools and the Personnel within them who will manage that right now we do have a superintendent Elders stated we do have comprehensive high schools and that is part of our communities asset as of as a district multiple venues for students to engage but in order to really align and measure completers we need to have high schools with strong programs of study and that's going to take work and I did the timing was just impeccable I met with our director of CTE today and she and I are on the same mindset that this is something that is feasible over time but we can get this work started difficult decisions are going to be half have to be made in regards to some of those Singleton elective classes looking at industry

[01:09:00]
what is in demand looking at our community assets within each of the high school zones to see how the community can partner and support that high school and those programs of study but we're not there yet and I think that's where we're uncomfortable and measuring all of those as one of our goals so we did Wordsmith some of it and so I paired it down to State the percentage of high school students who earn Credit in two or more advanced placement International Baccalaureate or dual credit courses or earn an industry certification or bilingual seal will increase from September 23rd to why in September of 2018 so that is not inclusive of everything but I wanted to share with you all as a leadership

[01:10:00]
the team we are doing a book study called the four disciplines of execution and superintendent Elder has them to give to each one of you but it really focuses on like we can't do it all and we can't be jack of all trades and master of none because at the end of the day we're all going to be defeated and so is our community and so in order to do that we need a hone in and be very focused in our goals have a minimum amount of gold so we can put our energy into those schools and and I feel like we're we're headed in that direction I I think that this could be something that we could measure identifying those instruments could be some of those Yazzie Martinez identified students in these areas but I strongly feel and I came from a high school

[01:11:00]
I did have strong programs of study and we only had four and we had 1600 students we don't have that in every High School which also creates an equity across the district for kids who do have them versus don't we do have a plan in place on how we're going to kind of move into that direction but it's going to take time it's just a clarifying question did you include dual enrollment on your list I just wanted to make sure I didn't so go ahead and that that's sounded great and I totally agree where I don't think and I don't think that what we're trying to do with this list is to be a jack of all trades so one of the suggestions that I was going to have was the approved list doesn't it doesn't matter now cuz you've already fixed it but it was we can have approved list and that whatever's on that approved list

[01:12:00]
Romero I think it's very important that we decide our goals tonight we said this is what we were going to do this is on our agenda we have told the community that this is something that is important and I really like how you edited it so that we can focus on that and then maybe some of the breadth later can come in the interim goals but for now let's focus on what we have data on and then if we need to later we can adjust but I appreciate you adjusting it and it I am ready to vote on what you just restated I agree I mean having heard you state you know the edit that you made and what you wanted to include that makes sense because that was it before us before so I was like worried that we would be making a decision that would put the district

[01:13:00]
tough spot and we don't want to put the district the students or the community in a tough spot I think we need to be very specific on how that will be measured and what will be looking at and I think it's important to note that not every student is going to be an AP student an IB student a dual credit or even these industry credentials I mean but if you have a school campus that is like able to do all of those things and it has that focus on their you start to see it sort of lift up and you start to see the quality of the education definitely improve my daughter had an opportunity to attend a school that had an IB program within it but it was I was grateful that she was not you know solely focused on just that I B it was it was great for her to be able to master into one of the IPI the IB tracks but she could still have that full High School experience and

[01:14:00]
so that's that's how I envisioned like our Comprehensive High Schools is that if a student chooses to want to do that but that it also becomes sort of the part of the culture of the school and it sort of invites and it encourages students to sort of get engaged in that kind of piece I think if we can build a culture of that you know within our schools and our Comprehensive High Schools it could be a great experience so so I appreciate the the the edit I think if Johanna captured that but it sounds like we have some writing that will help us and I think if you could read it just one more time for us and then I'll entertain a motion the percentage of high school students who earn Credit in two or more advanced placement International Baccalaureate or dual credit courses or earn an industry certification or by lingual seal will increase from X in September of 23 to why in September of 2018

[01:15:00]
and I apologize I'm going to have to ask that we make another edit okay if we're going to use industry certification or bilingual seal which are measured as they graduate it needs to be percentage of high school graduates because we're measuring students the student body each year so they'll be looking at the graduates that have made those goals and I have a quick clarification so in the first two goals we used May data but in your third goal you use September data do they need to is there a reason we used to September for that third goal well because next year will be our Baseline year of how many kids we have in so yes I just wanted to clarify since the other two had made and I think it's because the Mayda is tied to the state assessments and the September would be tied to end of year

[01:16:00]
graduation stats that we'd have by that time we wouldn't have it in May and I will be incorrect but if by having it be inclusive of high school students oh God then we leave out you know well I don't know you could show growth I guess with just so it's only one cohort of students it's not the whole it's not the whole District it's just at that point it's just seniors correct now because we have students who are sophomores who have already completed to that's true we have and we have students early as sophomore and Junior that are so earning industry credentials because I remember that so could I guess the question would be could the high school students be inclusive of our students who graduate so we're pulling up from I don't know

[01:17:00]
these are important details in the English teacher in me is saying you're rushing your revision on the dates so the May date is referring to the May test taking time or the results which we would get in September know we were supposed to get them in May is what we were stating correct superintendent we're hoping that we get them in May because this is assuming that pedal public education department process will be much more will be handled much more quickly than it has in years past we have tested in April and seeing the results sometime in October 6th so I don't know about me but should we do by their plans

[01:18:00]
I will say again that's not a trend line they haven't done it yet so they will give you about a year ago we were told their budging processes we're going to improve and they did do one reimbursement on time and we said awesome but once is not a trend and so I'd like to see him do it once but that's the theory we're using the information we've been provided by the people in the know well I like that and so I think with the proposed changes that board president to the first two goals in terms of wording as well as the language that chief of schools around 3 I would move that we vote tonight to approve those three goals okay so I think we're still but which language because I'm hearing that there's my motion

[01:19:00]
I think there was a point CounterPoint in terms of like inclusive of high school students would be inclusive of the graduates in that cohort and as we're looking at dates I'm wondering if we want to keep it as aligned with all three goals and pulling that summative data I'm wondering if we instead of may we can do June or July because at that point will have all of this information of our students who have earned their bilingual seals certifications will have all their courses finalized to be able to have that clear data and give a little bit of cushion to ped since they are known to push off deadlines little bit so I don't know that we necessarily have to be fully aligned on them if we're doing our progress monitoring by goal area so we would start our progress monitoring with the

[01:20:00]
so they don't necessarily have to be the same quarter even I agree with that as well because the monitoring schedule is going to be my goal and so I don't think it would it would impact that at all so I don't know if it needs to be September and correct me if I'm wrong are you wanting to amend it to like July something sooner so because we should have that information for your for your for the third goal okay so instead of September you're proposing June or July pick one I think Junior July is fine I think that's probably the least of our concerns I have Dr Bowman running down the stairs as we speak to weigh in on what he thinks that can actually be done so if you want to pause on that comment for a moment because he was the one

[01:21:00]
worrying about when this would be measured and I think he has the the soccer team upstairs watching with great interest to make sure they can do what's going to be asked so so shall we just wait for Dr Bowman for 5 more minutes OK Google here to make sure cuz we want this to be tight so it should be really good all right yeah we'll take a five minute thank you

[01:22:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:23:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:24:00]
but anyway with her assets

[01:25:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:26:00]
tomorrow and Monday okay I think we have all returned so Mr Gonzales were ready yes ma'am we are recording and streaming in the Mike's are alive I heard you ran downstairs so you've got the floor with some I think you had some input or some questions regarding some of the things that we're playing to track okay I've been listening pleasure relationship so

[01:27:00]
I listening to the conversation I'm very carefully so it's very good you know if we are going to include of these items that are measured after someone graduates like the bilingual seal or maybe the industry certification it's important to have the cohort the cohort needs to be the cohort that's measured at graduation as opposed to the cohort that's measured every single year or else so without the industry certification and the bilingual sales we can do this of all high school students but if we want to add those those things that kids get after they graduate then we would like do we need to use the number of graduates for the denominator for that correction so wow so would that be stated

[01:28:00]
instead of stating the percentage of high school students it would just be stated the percentage of high school graduates period can you go ahead and read the whole goal again because we're going to have to we're going to collect it from you too so let's just read it one more time the percentage of high school graduates who earn Credit in two or more advanced placement International Baccalaureate or dual credit courses or earn an industry certification or bilingual seal will increase from X in September of 23 to why in September of 2018 one more explanation for the September date we do have a number of students who graduate in the summer school in order to incorporate those into the graduation Court it would be good to have a September date that's excellent I agree with that too okay real quick there is a motion on the floor for the first reading so

[01:29:00]
Danielle would you make friendly amendments my motion to accept this proposed language that Dr Segura just read along with the revised language to goals one and two okay and doesn't need a second because there was already an emotional on the floor so so we're good enough and non-problematic enough to proceed with the use of the high school graduates for our denominator we will be able to calculate this number okay and it makes sense this is a post secondary goal so great I want to hug you don't thank you for running downstairs it takes a village the team is great

[01:30:00]
all right so I think we have emotion we have a second so may I have a roll call please and what we're doing is on the goals as amended for all three Amelia Arizona Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson this will help you yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes thank you I'm glad that you were here to hear it all right so she's on the ground somewhere obviously hopefully okay so our next item is just a report from superintendent Elder on strategic plan is it Alliance to the student outcomes and this is just a discussion just where we are and on the work that we're doing there so bored number

[01:31:00]
your present Cordova members of the board as we continue to work on the goals and guardrails I'd like to provide you an update as well on our work with the tune to build the Strategic plan to help us meet these goals as I shared in early December attuned was completing its work to gather insights through a variety of data points to help inform my teams reflection on what is going well in APS and what areas Improvement help us to be more effective in reaching our goals since my update to you on December 7th June has oh gracious technology so since my update to you on December 7th at noon has summarize their key takeaways from reviewing our District's academic performance data visiting over 180 classrooms and engaging with various stakeholders through a series of focus groups and they facilitated to work sessions with my leadership team focused on reflecting on past District implementation efforts and discussing the outcomes of the organizational Diagnostics

[01:32:00]
as I shared before a tune created a scope and sequence for the strategic planning process that aligns with the board's goals and guardrails work specifically given the current trajectory of confirming those goals tonight or immediate next steps with the tunes starting now through February are to codify a draft set of priorities this week as an internal team responsive to the board's goals guardrails in the organizational analysis they've completed two convenient advisory committee made up of teachers principles family members and Community leaders to provide feedback on key elements of the Strategic plan with the first element being the draft strategic priorities this group will meet for the first time next week and will be engaged several other times throughout the spring and identify and sequence multi-year initiatives alive to the Strategic priorities by the end of February so we are excited about the bus fare and will invite

[01:33:00]
tune to an upcoming board meeting to provide additional updates and to gather feedback on elements of the planning process any questions comments from the classroom visits the focus groups and your two work sessions into an organized organizational diagnostic report can you share like what were some of those takeaways at least at a high level what I think some of the positives that were noted were actually discussed tonight pride in the bilingual Shield people are happy that we have a comprehensive list of offerings for kids that they can actually have an opportunity to explore interests and that's not just at the high school level that's even at the elementary middle school with clubs and opportunities one thing that came through and I think that anybody here who is a Native Americans

[01:34:00]
people are intensely proud of their neighborhood schools the whole concept in the way we introduced ourselves to each other hi I'm Scott oh hi I'm Dave where did you go to school actually came out in in that that that that work on the other hand I think that we saw some things that we really can focus on the need for a Clear Vision the need for a clear set of expectations that run not just across the district but from the district into schools and into the classroom a sense of accountability for people and how how that system operates account that they are held accountable and equally to their peers so you know we have a sense of of that in the schools along those lines

[01:35:00]
one of the things people which is very pleasing to me spoke about specifically the principles was the principal PD and how they felt that the district and the board had finally invested in them as leaders and that they felt that they were receiving quality support and instruction on how to dress some of these things I think there are concerns about usage of the high quality instructional materials and how we can push that information out and how to help people understand what qualifies a material as a high quality instructional material that was some question as to who made that decision based off of the National Organization that recognizes the books in some cases didn't know that wasn't high quality or said we don't they didn't read it but if it was high quality construction

[01:36:00]
is in the classrooms that were using the materials grade levels work was being done to standards and then unfortunately and some of the classes were there was not used to the high-quality instructional materials that didn't always meet standards so I don't think it was anything that caught us completely unaware but I think it gave us some pretty high overarching goals and that's what we're going to really finalized on Friday is the basically 4 elements and strategic priorities that they've mentioned for us moving forward in terms of the planet and we'll be able to see that diagnostic report I think it's some point yes right now it's it's still a draft and we're still using it I'd like to kind of work through that and that really was entitled for us but I do think we can share that at some point okay thank you great thank you

[01:37:00]
for a board member to attend the 2023 Council of great City Schools annual legislative policy conference this is a discussion action before we go can I have just emotion that kind of asked for a motion for this and then we'll have the discussion afterwards I will move for approval to of consideration for one board member to attend 2023 cancel great City Schools this is Crystal thank you Crystal now we can have some discussion Joanna do you have some updates on this for us at schools annual legislative policy conference for superintendent school board members

[01:38:00]
and legislative directors will be held March 18th through March 21st in Washington DC in recent years we've only had one board member of 10 the conference due to tight budgets that are prevented us from sending more members we've also in the past send a policy analyst as you all know we are in the process of hiring a policy analyst but we don't have one at this time so we do believe that we could you could if you chose consider sending us second members as well and we're asking that you make a decision tonight so that we can go ahead and get whoever's going registered for the conference all right so let's have some discussion on this this is March 18th through the 21st and DC do I have any first of all any interested folks in attending

[01:39:00]
things that are moving through Congress so if you are interested in that and the great City Schools educational priorities in Congress and briefings from congressional staff and Department of Education it's interesting for that and the networking to meet other board members and District leaders I've had an opportunity to do

[01:40:00]
not policy conference once too I think it mine was like probably about 4 years ago it's I think the value is definitely a meeting some of the other board members from across the country you get an idea of what some of the things that they're doing as well it is very heavy it's very heavy on the policy side and sometimes that guy that delivers it is just like he's pretty dry because it goes on and on and on and it's it's pretty long so I mean we don't have to send to we have this opportunity but if I don't know if anyone is is interested or available once to I would love to go but that is during spring break and we already planned our spring break trip okay I also have a conflict you're looking at me like no I know it does not have to do

[01:41:00]
I kind of have a big life announcement I guess I could say I have made a decision to retire and I know I wasn't kind of a cool thing so I have been housed my intent to retire so I am I'm actually available I have some time if if there's interest in nobody else wants to do it or I'm willing to attend to to support or to represent APS all not this is Barbara on nominate but

[01:42:00]
I was I was interested to attend with Yolanda there you go we could go together so we can send two people that's excellent that's even better much much better all right so there was a motion and a second on the floor for Yolanda and so okay so can we have a roll call on that please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes right let the travel our next is consideration for approval of the aps open meetings act resolution do I have a motion for this first and then we'll go into discussion I will move for consideration to approve the aps open meetings act resolution while second this is Danielle Wright any discussion

[01:43:00]
got all the questions answered were good all right may I have a roll call please on did Young Gonzalez yes Robert Peterson yes yes I need Jackson yes the last ones a little bit tricky I need to pull up my agenda on this one this one is consideration for approval of APs Board of Education participation in organizations and they had sent out to us a list of all the organizations that are available and I don't even want to go into emotion on this one first because I think we have to have a discussion in terms of what individuals are interested in and then we either flip a coin we decide on on this piece in terms of of where people are attending

[01:44:00]
so I'll start with board member top of Romero do you have any preferences thoughts you are okay with the way it is in a world going to the to that last big long thing so this basically just we have a board of education meetings first and third special board forth there's the policy committee we've got them the only thing I would say because it has me listed on a Ys but I was not able to serve okay on that because I had a work conflict with the same time and I believe in my spot for that you know yeah I was but I'm going to stick with a tall order that's enough that's a lot so anybody else interested in the youth Symphony not I will cover it

[01:45:00]
you can cover it okay that would be great so I think the other let me go through this list real quick cuz this is probably the easiest way just the challenge with their meetings is there on Mondays and at times we have our meetings as well okay so that we've got the Community Capital advisory with sophina Dominguez on that Equity advisory they've invited to us as well go on a rotating basis so we'll shift out the shack currently it's Peggy Mueller and Danielle you still interested in that one board member I don't even know is it meeting I was going to be my question I know I haven't even heard of meetings right now huh so we'll have to find that out so super antenna Johanna he could find out on the shack I haven't heard of I haven't even seen a meeting announced calendar committee board member Jackson you're on that and then the

[01:46:00]
policies and procedures monthly meeting when we went to the meeting board member to Romero had talked about us having a presence at that meeting with the tribal councils they requested some board members to be selected to serve on this so it doesn't we could have just one representative on that what are the dates that that means I'm interested in that you're interested in that one okay it's each month and there's different topics I mean this could also be one that we could go on a rotating basis so if we could do it that way rotating basis on that I think that would be best because I think all of us should have some experience with the tribal council and listening to their needs the external organizations the aps Foundation I covered that one as the president and boards on that as an alternate the ABC

[01:47:00]
Community Schools I know that board member Peterson and Peggy Miller out of going were very interested in remaining on that I'm obviously not going to have a role in that with my cuz I'm not going to be working anymore but are there any is there any concerns about board member Mueller Audible and Barbara Peterson continuing okay let's see the abcdc bored let's work for that we're working on that one and then Albuquerque I'll go ahead and you said you were going to cover it so Chris Courtney

[01:48:00]
the youth Symphony economic Forum we're all invited let's see mid Council the Mr Cog is still going to be Peterson and Josie and Josie it's not it's not Crystal but it's Josie on there so it's Barbara and Josie with the Mr Cog and that's a heady group I don't know thank you guys for doing that the cancel great City Schools I still am attending that meeting every Friday there's a meeting that I attend I continued with that board member will continue with Noel we're all part of nsba and nmsba and I think that's it so with all that said I think we made the changes we made the only question

[01:49:00]
with nmsba has to do with being on the board and I'm happy to continue with that if someone else is dying to do it I am happy to step back but I'm happy to continue it's part of what I've been doing you got the thumbs up Barbara carry on okay I looked into it there's a membership fee and you have to reply so I am a member cuz I've been a member previously so if others want to be members they can but it's not necessarily all board members okay so Johanna you've caught that one okay all right so with all those changes and all of those proposals do I have we have a motion on this one

[01:50:00]
the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday February 1st 2023 at 5 p.m. in the John Miller Community boardroom of the Alice Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or virtually at www.aps.edu and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held
