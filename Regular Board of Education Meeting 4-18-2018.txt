good afternoon Board of Education members superintendent radio associate superintendent Blakey my name is Courtney Henman and a special education teacher at AHS I'm here tonight to speak to the concerns about teacher representation on the inevitable hiring committee for our new principal I have a letter here that states the position of staff at AHS in regards to the matter in short our Collective position is that all teacher representation on the hiring committee needs to be selected by us the staff and not by admin we are currently in the nomination process at Albuquerque High and will very soon be submitting a list of our colleagues who have been selected to serve on our behalf thank you

[00:35:00]
and I just want to reiterate that it is the unified will of the staff at Albuquerque High School that we have a democratic staff driven process to select our new principal it's important that these decisions be made in a timely manner the board and District leadership should honor our demand as soon as possible so that we have ample time to review candidates conduct interviews and select a principal and a thoughtful manner it is crucial to us that we ensure our new school leadership aligns with our school culture and Community thank you for social studies teachers

[00:36:00]

[00:37:00]
all right good afternoon superintendent Reedy Mr President other members of the board thank you for the opportunity to speak here today my name is Chase Bailey and I am a senior at El Dorado High School and I'm also currently the student body second Vice President we are here today to advocate for students in light of the recent tragedy at El Dorado High School and the increasing rate of suicides among high schoolers never before has a generation been under such scrutiny to put forth an agreeable image in a world where communication is constantly at our fingertips we have somehow lost the ability to genuinely share with others not to believe that today we may be able to solve this problem completely is drastically impractical however if we allow ourselves to believe that what we do today is incapable of making a difference we will never know how bright tomorrow could be therefore it's time we started dressing this issue head on

[00:38:00]
we must strive to erase the stigma associated with things like depression and anxiety we want the district to invest more resources at the school site for students to access Mental Health Care the cost of this endeavor would be infinitesimal compared to the impact it could make on the future of our society as a whole it won't be easy but nothing worth working towards in life ever is thank you mister president superintendent board members and community members I'm Alyssa Bernardino a student Senator and a senior at El Dorado I'm here to talk to talk about the largest issue that is plaguing our community and that is mental health with no focus on Mental Health provided by schools and make students feel as though their mental health is not important or viable problem to pay attention to our schools have an athletic trainer for physical health but

[00:39:00]
do you like a professional whose job purpose is solely in the interest of the minds of students students cannot be expected to perform at the best of their ability if there is no focus on their complete well-being students are struggling are too nervous to ask for help we must find a way to meet them at least halfway to show that we care and that we can hear them we want the district to invest more resources at the school site for students to access Mental Health Care thank you hello this is an incredible number that is completely unacceptable these years are critical for students maturation into adults of the best people I've ever known will never be able to see their future

[00:40:00]
please to feel safe they did not have the ability to speak I have not seen a single statement from the school board regarding students mental health if a student is hurting how do you expect them to perform well in school but not addressing these issues the leaders of APs are embracing the stigma against mental health issues by not making change you're being complacent an employee to invest in your students out of the 142 schools in APS only 12 have school-based health centers out of those 12 they're none located in the far Northeast Heights or North West Albuquerque students need to know that they have a place to go when they are physical or mental pain there are no full-time psychologist on campus counselors are not theirs and it is unfair to treat them as such I believe it would be a wise investment to have an on-campus psychologist to students mental health needs we want the district to invest more resources at the school site for students to access Mental Health Care thank you

[00:41:00]
is the next three Keegan Keegan McCown can't say that last name Elsie Stott and Brianna Frazier thank you Mr President is the leading cause of death for kids ages 12 to 19 El Dorado this year alone we have experienced Force suicides my sophomore year the football team experience one and it was tough for all of us to end we understand the aps wants to safe environment for kids in our schools but hasn't made any strides to try and help with this problem we want the district to invest more resources at school sites for students to access Mental Health Care a recommendation would be adding confidential student health centers

[00:42:00]
bulls that don't already have them thank you for your time good afternoon and with my fellow colleagues and we would like to Echo that the Democratic representation of our staff members on the committee to hire a new principal is very important to us we really are invested in what goes on day to day in our school we are members of our school Community we are invested in the students that are there and we feel that we have all the knowledge and the understanding of our school environment to help make the best decisions in hiring a principal who can continue to move Albuquerque High School forward and to unite our entire faculty our student body and to really read and to help us move forward with strength and with a unifying figure at the front

[00:43:00]
so please take those requests and and our letter we are here as representatives of our staff thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak on the issues that I brought us here today my name is Brianna Frazier and I am a senior at El Dorado High School recently El Dorado has suffered many tragic losses of our students We Believe to the lack of access or students have to Mental Health Care the issue of suicide in Illinois is an epidemic but as a special district in community heart I believe we can send a powerful message by focusing our money and efforts on mental health so that we can be more preventive we expect great things period thank you

[00:44:00]
for your time I'm going to also call it the last four Shania or Shania Jurado Tyler Mitchell Brian Kendall and Eric Olivas good afternoon period in order to take responsibility on this recent

[00:45:00]

[00:46:00]
that could be done to prevent this from happening again we want the district to invest more resources at the school site for students to access Mental Health Care thank you good evening Mr President school on board members superintendent reading thank you for allowing me to speak my name is Brian Kendall and I'm a senior at El Dorado High School I'm here to address the issue of mental health the morning of April 9th was a morning that I will remember for the rest of my life has the news spread around campus the look of shock could be seen on every student's face shrieks crying yelling all followed by a sign silence that was absolutely deafening my younger brother was best friends with Blake's the sophomore that killed himself last Sunday night

[00:47:00]
I had no words to help them cope what can I say the Eldorado group is here not about Blake it includes him but it revolves around a bigger issue and that issue is mental health we want the district to invest more resources at the school site for student access mental health care please allow us to bring about a change that will possibly help the next victim of suicide and definitely create a happier healthier student body thank you guys for allowing me to speak tonight and thank you for your service of Northeast Heights community policing Council I'm here tonight to talk about the role of this board in this District in the crime problem that we see here in our city

[00:48:00]
it's becoming increasingly concerning to me that many of our schools are failing and they're producing or complacent in the production of many individuals that do not have the opportunities for economic success and vibrancy that builds our community and makes us a better place to live and build a family and that sort of thing I have a window into one of your school's Matheson Park Elementary School this is a school that's a d rated school it's been a d rated school for many years as far as I know and this year this school is moving to cut even more resources I presume because of the budget this board produced I don't know if that's true but they're cutting an instructional coach cutting technology resources already very limited resources and cutting teaching positions I understand this is a small school compared to some of the other schools in the district but it's very concerning to me both as citizen

[00:49:00]
and as somebody that's interested in the crime problem here in the city that the resources that are available to this District do not seem to be allocated in a way that's going to help the school succeed I suspect this will be a school that will see State intervention on very soon and I'd like to see the board take action before the state comes in and demands changes here as they have it at many of your other schools so I do hope that you all can can work together with the community on this problem and see if we can address this in a way that puts resources into the schools that are struggling rather than taking them away thank you guys for your time thank you for your input this concludes public forum thank you board president Dr pearcey board members community members and staff

[00:50:00]
look once of the students here tonight was very moving and I want to take this opportunity to add more information since August there have been over there have been a $1,094 student suicide referrals of these over half were evaluated to have high suicide risk factors when we have a referral we move as quickly as we can and evaluate the the student and half were high suicide because more students are being identified as having suicidal ideations APS was able to provide interventions with more than a thousand students and their families

[00:51:00]
last year during the 2016-17 school year there were 703 student threat assessments these are students now this is slightly different these are students who threatened to harm others and we immediately provide a threat assessment in these situations this year within with two months still left in the school year we already have $826 assessments this reflects 826 times that school principals the threat assessment director and or the school psychologist being able to intervene when a student was threatening to hurt another student or staff member I'm very thankful for all the people who worked tirelessly to keep our students safe and healthy but it's not enough

[00:52:00]
it is never enough it is Never Enough when young lives are in the balance and we have heard these young voices and I want to thank them for being here tonight I think what they said really hit home for us and I want to say that we will follow their lead and really start looking and seeing what else we can do how we can support our students that are hurting in this manner so now we go to school materials and curriculum many voices and perspectives have been represented as curriculum and instruction has worked to select Elementary English language arts materials this has been long and coming as you know budget cuts have not helped us move forward as quickly as we would like as far as school materials but the selection process went through several stages first

[00:53:00]
potential Publishers were screened through outside evaluators such as such as Ed reports by the curriculum and instruction Department 7 Publishers were selected for district review these Publishers were evaluated using the instructional materials evaluation tool by a group of 37 reviewers including principles District administrators reading specialist from both General and special ed instructional coaches representatives from all departments as well as the Albuquerque teachers Federation three Publishers were selected for final review that would be Pearson readygen Benchmark advance and great minds wit and wisdom teacher representatives were selected from elementary schools and trained in both the use of the instructional materials evaluation tool and selecting instructional materials that

[00:54:00]
Lance equity and respond to school and Community needs these teachers individually reviewed the three Publishers over a 2-week period also all elementary principals and teachers who were also provided with digital resources from each of the Publishers and were asked to provide feedback through an online survey I'm excited to hear the final proposal which will go to the cabinet for review at the end of April so that we can start moving forward and getting the materials at the students need the student family and community supports division will be able to fund behaviors in every Elementary School next school year you heard about the behavior of the finance committee meeting and again I want to stress that it is a non-punitive strategy that is used with students that are having

[00:55:00]
play some difficulty with their behavior the position was developed for elementary schools that have seen a significant rise in inappropriate student behaviors although Dr Muir and I shared many of the details related to this new position itself I'd like to share a few more of the principles reactions after notifying Elementary principles that they were eligible for a behavior redirector Dr Muir received several positive comments come back and frankly was really sweet to to read the responses Bandelier Elementary School principal said thank you for recognizing the need for redirected in elementary schools it seems there are more and more students who need Crisis Support marketing principal Mandy Walker rights this is incredible all caps incredible news thanks for listening to our concerns

[00:56:00]
truly appreciated and Armijo principal and a Chavez writes this support will be much needed resource for our students as we build a new positive behavior culture at our schools and of course this is another thing that we're doing as far as this really duct tape what I want to say is that this dovetails beautifully with our academic master plan and looking and supporting the whole Child So speaking about safety APS has formed a new committee to review site security and safety the APS Security assessment and implementation committee this committee is made up of members of the Albuquerque Public School Police Department the capital master plan facility design and construction maintenance and operation and instructional technology and is overseeing by the chief operations officer Scott

[00:57:00]
Elder more than 150 APS traditional and charter schools have been divided into 13 groups to be visited by the security assessment team over the next few months currently the team has visited approximately 14 sites per week they are very busy the team reviews a number of factors at each School these factors include cameras door access fencing Gates and overall access to the site principals will be working with these assessment teams and will be able to offer their input as to what may be needed at the individual schools once completed all 150 + assessments will be reviewed and a project plan will be developed to place new equipment and technology in our schools you may have heard of this as it is referred to the word

[00:58:00]
hardening the school the idea is to restrict access and to allow staff greater ability to secure an area quickly it is hardening but it is it's it's it's we want to harden our schools because strange word we want to harden our schools but we also want to make them keep them friendly and welcoming so it's it's something that we're going to try and do keep that balance because we certainly don't want our schools to be look like jails or anything like that Albuquerque taxpayers have already funded a significant portion of this work in past Mill Levy elections and we cannot thank them enough for their support and we've been doing this for years now so for us we've been we've been using the middle of judiciously

[00:59:00]
again to ensure safety for our students the New Mexico legislature has allocated an additional 40 million for the state over the next 4 years to be used for making our schools safer we anticipate that APS would receive about 2 1/2 million dollars each year of those funds community members will see evidence of this work as we add fencing and begin to install card access readers at our schools some of the work maybe less evident as we upgrade security systems that include improved cameras and an overhaul to the district alarm system for free able to receive updated floor plans to individual schools as well and this is thanks to a new electronic system developed by APS

[01:00:00]
schools are increasing lockdown practices and in response to student requests just like we heard here we are practicing at different times of the day so that staff and students will know how to react in different situations currently our chief operations officer are executive director of maintenance and operation and our chief of police are attending a National Conference examining best practices across the country and the word back from them is that the sessions are being are very very useful we continue to look for ways to improve the safety of our students and staff and so this Friday April the 20th is the anniversary of the Columbine High School incident a national school walkout is being encouraged through national news social media and websites like National School walk-up

[01:01:00]
unlike the walk out in March this is not a 17 minute walk out and nationally students are being encouraged to walk out at 10:00 and not return to class this is a concern on many levels including the safety of our students in March we sent a principles a letter with a series of ideas and suggestions that they may use at their school and I'm working closely with the leadership team and strongly encouraging principles to work with their students to develop on campus activities that can occur before during or after school as always we want to support the students in school stuff in a way that both encourages education and safety and so now the parcc test APS technology and office of accountability and Reporting have reserved space in the aps

[01:02:00]
you can complex from April 9th to May 14th to fully support Park testing the space will be used as a base of operation for technician dispatch and tech support calls for both Oar and APS technology the benefits of this command and call center include and there's a picture right up there for you prompt support for parcc testing which can help improve overall test scores by avoiding confusing and frustrating situations in schools also offers collaboration between Oar and APS technology resulting in consistent solutions to problems that may arise and it's a set of computer and phone work stations as well as extra testing device storage ages that testing devices that are stored there that will not hinder the workflow of employees in other areas of the district

[01:03:00]
with our centralized impromptu Command Center I like that term we have a team of texts and testing professionals that will respond quickly and efficiently to the requests of all schools and thankful for the work of the technology department and the office of accountability and reporting for doing everything that they've done to support our participation in park and that concludes a superintendent's report thank you thank you I thought there for a minute Hospital

[01:04:00]
play some comments and also I appreciate the superintendent for clarifying A few things I think there's some things that we don't know that happen and some of those things are because there's privacy issues there's there are certain confidentiality that sometimes we don't share because of the family because of other things and so there are a lot of things that are going on in terms of the issues that some of you have a raise both sides tell you the truth so stay around if you can I know that it goes on a little while and you got other things to do like school but we appreciate all of you being here and so if you can't stay around I'm sure you'll have some comments and there are several here that hopefully we can get through fairly quickly and that you're on the target here for several and this is the first one is a consideration for the approval of the timeline for the 2018

[01:05:00]
is it in Piercy members of the board spring tenant Reedy tonight with input from the superintendent you have three items in in front of you all related to the super evaluation the timeline and process needs to be approved the procedural directive has a couple of changes and then a review and a possible revision of the evaluation survey tool so the first thing is the timeline in the process so according to your procedural directive there are to be three informal check-ins and conversations throughout the year in April July and October and so I have tentatively scheduled those times you actually have existing meetings on these dates so this coming Monday morning April 23rd would be the first one the next one would be July 18th in the third one would be October 3rd then for the summer formal evaluation that's a more in-depth process

[01:06:00]
we would send that out to you all the actual survey tool November 2nd you would have the chance about a week to independently evaluate the superintendent using that evaluation form you would return it to the board Services office we would have about a week to compile all of your individual scores into one document and then we would send that document home in your weekend packets on November 16th to give you a chance to see how your answers are compared or in comparison to your fellow board members then we would have a special board meeting on November 20th where the board would meet alone where you would have a chance to talk collectively about all of your responses and hopefully come up with some sort of a consensus ranking for the superintendent so she doesn't have 70 evaluations but she really truly has one

[01:07:00]
evaluation from the Board of Education and then on November 26th you would meet with the superintendent and review all of those items that you previously discussed and provide feedback in written form for her she would have 15 working days to respond in writing if if she's so chooses and then on the meeting of the December 19th you would have the opportunity to review update and vote on the superintendent contract so that is the timeline and proposed process so that's the first item on the agenda any comments from the board member this is pretty standard that we've had it's just a matter of setting up specific dates so that we can actually said before

[01:08:00]
any comments at all I'll entertain him okay do you have a second it's been moved and seconded all in favor please say hi I'll opposed thank you for going to the next day so the next time is actually your procedural directive and this year in 2018 they're actually all of the the dates and months actually worked out so they're very few changes the only change that we would make would be in the summative feedback that you would schedule your executive session in November rather than December and that's really the only the only change in 2019 of course there will be many more changes but for

[01:09:00]
Percy when it comes to providing perceptions that's a hard thing to do to provide perceptions I don't know if that's the right word that should be in there I don't know if it's providing an analysis providing observations but providing a perception perception is more how I feel I can't really explain that as much as I could if I was analyzing or just giving even an opinion or my viewpoints so I just think that word and it's used several times so I just have a hard time with trying to provide my perception what a better word would you prefer I mean what words I mean some of the ones I looked at work I don't know the words I thought viewpoints analysis observations feedback assessment views opinions

[01:10:00]
to me it's my perception is hard to talk to explain would you prefer the word viewpoints I mean to me that's the same thing but then it kind of changes something else though observations is the other one that I thought might be good and then it's used again under Summit to feedback to the superintendent and the first sentence so I don't know if the same word should just be

[01:11:00]
occur

[01:12:00]
that's just a hard sentence to to to understand explanations for strengths and areas of performance I mean I think what it is is trying to identify that the board is trying to identify the strengths and weaknesses in the superintendent's performance and offer suggestions or giving feedback on both I mean I'm pretty sure that that's what we mean there I think that's what it says to me the portable identify and provide explanations for strengths to do in the evaluation for measure

[01:13:00]
reasonable statement of what we think for the superintendent so I don't think there's any confusion in there to everybody else I mean that's okay exclamation mark

[01:14:00]
and provide explanations for I mean identifying is the Israel in the same kind of a context in my opinion I think that might sound like we just say well identify strengths and areas of superintendents performance that sounds good period will identify and explain strengths and areas of superintendent's performance work growth can occurred OK Google

[01:15:00]
will have the opportunity to provide feedback regarding performance of the board I think feedback regarding our performance comes from the voters that put us in our positions so but I know I've said that before so I don't think that should be there it's always

[01:16:00]
and I think Lorenzo if it would not have performance just giving us feedback but on our performance that's up to the voters to decide how we perform but I understand about the feedback you know I don't mind eliminating performance but I do think it is useful for me to get a sense of is what we do helpful is it helpful to me say this relationship with the word open for the superintendent that we're not just saying

[01:17:00]
about our relationship that we just say the superintendent has an opportunity during this session to provide feedback to the board and it leaves it open but that's not that's not what we're talking about is our relationship with the board we're talking about how are we doing how are we working together what's that collaboration going on and are we really working together so should we highlight that and just say provide feedback regarding the collaboration and the partnership with the boards all right let me summarize it real quick the three uses of perceptions will be turned into observations the board will identify and provide explanation for the boardwalk

[01:18:00]
and the last one is that will provide feedback regarding his her relationship with the board is that satisfactory with guns up OK Google

[01:19:00]
in the to make it more quick perhaps are there any major changes that someone might suggest and if they're a minor changes let's just provide them to Brandon she can maybe incorporate this get them back to us and we can work on that a little bit because I think we have a little bit of time to get this evaluation so I don't want to spend a huge amount of seconds

[01:20:00]
we want change we want to discuss that now and then little things that we're not covering just from a suggestion point of view and then maybe details could be put in you know later the only thing that I see when I was looking at some other evaluations is that they had more delineated specifically has a superintendent improved outcomes whether it comes to like graduation rate some of them did it by it will improve yearly by this percentage some of it was just brought and said have the academic you know outcomes improved have the graduation rates improved instead of some of them did it more specifically they did test scores and it just depended on the school district some of them just had a specific percentage some of them just left it just left it brought so those that was the only thing that

[01:21:00]
start needed to be put in probably some under under probably academic outcomes I guess that's just kind of a broad one but I don't know how that would if you'd want them all separate you know graduation rates scores achievement Gap I don't know or that may not be something that the board wants to put in there at all it's just we measure outcomes for our kids for our schools for our teachers so that's it okay that probably could be something within the academic master plan

[01:22:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:23:00]
so maybe what you could do Peggy is to why don't you dress maybe a statement or two within the academic master plan that you think would be useful to do and we'll give it to Brenda and then we'll take a look at that as we as we go on and look at the details of maybe changes can we just put off phone until we see it because I don't think that's fair for anybody to vote on something that they haven't even seen what we might write well I think that's certainly OK Google so that's why it's here tonight so I think what we can do is

[01:24:00]
I think again what we can do is take a look at this in some detail as we have a chance look at the questions see if in fact they pretty much capture the things you know like a board member we really got over this kind of once not too long ago so I don't suspect we want to have a huge amount of change but there may be a few changes like you mentioned so I suggest all of us go and and look at this carefully provide her kind of organized those changes and then come back to us with some of the suggested changes and then see what we think about maybe a discussion tonight

[01:25:00]
superintendent's already mentioned in some of our some of our students have mentioned and again I don't think there's any doubt that these areas of concern you know I think we all have said that in the past we said mental health has been a big issue to us there's all kinds of questions about how you do that and how you find it and exactly what it means but I think we could do a call out specifically so helpful

[01:26:00]
is part of what's in the academic master plan is addressing the needs of the whole child I can't remember how it's How It stated exactly in the academic master plan but just to make sure that those major points and definitely mental health counseling address just to spell that out and we can take a look I do have I mean just like I have real concerns about the way that the teacher evaluation is now on Effectiveness rather than competency I have a real issue with that and I know there's disagree I think that because this is the superintendent I think that we have every expectation in the superintendent and

[01:27:00]
summary of of what's going on that the things like the outcomes of graduation what is what's the trend what what's happening with all of that I mean I think we'd certainly expect to hear that in in the superintendent presentation that she gives to us is part of the evaluation but I would really resist coming up with some kind of adequate yearly progress numbers to randomly put on I mean I think that the real issue is how is the district being organized to address how is it being organized and what's being implemented to to accomplish the goals and then look at that because that's really the role of the superintendent

[01:28:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:29:00]
and they're the ones who need to tell us what can they do and and and and within the resources and so forth that they have right and so that's part of the deal and then we need to listen to say okay let's see how we do that and I think that's kind of part of the deal so the question is what do we have in here that says and then again I think again

[01:30:00]
I want to be careful with how I use those and make sure that if there are any value at all that they get back to our teachers and I get back to the education aspects of what we're trying to do so I think that's a complex thing it's complex and I want I like kind of the superintendent to help us with that that aspect of it this is the evaluation of the superintendent who is putting forward her best thinking and turns out how we're going to move forward as a district so for example you talked this evening about the directors I'm assuming you have a baseline or an idea of where we're at now and where you intend to be in a certain period of time it's been

[01:31:00]
big challenge with our RDA folks that often they end up feeling in the bubbles for people who make assumptions about what we should be as a district and my concern is we need to decide where we're going to be as a district based on the superintendent's leadership and her thinking and that of your staff My Hope Is that we can follow your lead in this respect and then think to get together with you as to whether or not we're making progress and getting there in terms of the goals that you have in mind for us I feel like if we were to come up with some of the other kinds of evaluative sort of observations they get put on us it's kind of like walking on Jello you just don't know where you're going to are you going to land and I don't have confidence in a number of

[01:32:00]
the tools that are currently being used have not made any bones about that but I am concerned that you know how do we measure things like our organizational culture we have a group of teachers here this evening who would like input and I think we need to show that we're listening we need to work to help students be more than just tokens in their relationship to us but how do we begin to help follow their lead and take empowerment seriously so that you know I'm Blown Away by someone and I appreciate you stepping up and saying yes we have to look at this and thank you for being here but we want to make sure that we're following your lead

[01:33:00]
okay so I think again fast forward is to have individuals take a look at this provide some input back in terms of any changes you think might be useful here editions rewording whatever and then we'll bring this back for a further discussion in terms of kind of finalizing maybe some of the details so we'll we'll rely on you to bring it back in a timely manner and and guys if you really want to put something in please put something in it don't wait until it's time for us to look at it again and say oh I have a whole lot of things now I need to put in that's going to make everybody really happy OK Google to select one APS student to be sent as a nominee for the 1,000 New Mexico School

[01:34:00]
where is Association 2018 scholar and that's like really period

[01:35:00]
my random number generator will give me one we can do it three times and also have all the names in an envelope we can pull them out by random selection because there's no way to decide which of these which which of these students is more worthy they are all incredible and I would I would recommend that we do it by random selection hey Google

[01:36:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:37:00]
is Savannah was that the one from Amazon OK Google of the authorization

[01:38:00]
what's the option to purchase a property lease purchase arrangement for the Lamberton Place Northeast all entertain a motion for approval all in favor and I want to explain this to everybody out there this is a property that's right now data is in that building and they will be in there from what I understand for about three more years or so and then they will be moving out so far we have data has paid rent to APS for over 3 million almost 4 million dollars it was I think it was appraised at 3. 5

[01:39:00]
in that has been put in and what we're going to pay for this and just so everybody knows whoever did this did a really really poor job with that lease to have a triple net lease all the money that we put in that 3.7 3.8 million dollars isn't getting put toward the purchase price so it was a bad deal a really really bad deal and we're buying this property for 3.5 so we're buying something that's worth burying you know 3 1/2 million but we really going to end up spending like 7 million dollars on something like that and then when we're going to sell it I don't know what we're going to end up selling this building cuz we're likely not going to be able to use it for a school because it's industrial building not meant for a school so I just have a hard time just being fiduciary and

[01:40:00]
is it supposed to be taken care of taxpayers money to be able to spend 7 million for something that isn't worth that so I just think that we were swindled cheated whatever charge too much for something and we're buying buildings in a declining enrollment across the entire State not just here at APS so that is the reason I'm trying to take care of your money so that's the reason I'm not voting for it ok Google

[01:41:00]
this evening incredible group of people and in reference to community volunteers I also wanted to shine a light on Jennifer Reardon who was on the stage with us not too long ago from Wells Fargo who died tragically yesterday with the Southwest Airlines flight so she was incredible Community partner and she will be truly missed I also wanted to point out that we are as a board very invested in the health safety and well-being of all of our students which is why we volunteer our time to serve on the board into work closely with APS leadership we love and support each one of our students and we are very invested in your your safety and your well-being in terms of our safety assessment perhaps we could also look at Mental Health Services assessment and have a better understanding of the kind of services that are being provided and not just the services the mental health services that are being provided but how they're being

[01:42:00]
promoted to our students and and if they're even aware we know that we hear a great work that takes place but we want to make sure that that's being promoted to our students as well and that they have access so in addition to the safety assessment which we do desperately need and we appreciate your work on that I would personally like to see a mental health services assessment as well and what is out there also would like to thank all of our teachers that came here to express their views and opinions on wanting to be a part of the hiring process and to our community members who are concerned about the schools in their community and and wanting to be a part of that process as well so thank you each and every one of you for being here tonight thank you thank you thank you thank you

[01:43:00]
I guess the safety assessment team great idea I mean this is something that is really needed in the district and so thank you so very much for your work and what an amazing group of volunteers I mean you cannot say enough about what they do for our students and our community as a whole truly amazing and I'm glad I got to meet many of these folks it's a pleasure and an honor to El Dorado students and community and teachers who are here my heart goes out to you and I am truly it's very difficult this is really hard this is really difficult for me my father was a came in from the military in World War he was part of World War II and he suffered I think it back then

[01:44:00]
there was no diagnosis for PTSD he suffered from PTSD and actually committed suicide he had a Bible in one hand and a gun in the other so this hits pretty close to me and I think that we could do a little more in APS I'm good I was only 2 years old at the time so you know I mean life has gone on so one of the things that I wanted to say is I think if we look at our budget if we could look a little closer to see if we can go if we can get more prices or take a look at this as a whole and evaluate and I think he has said is that we do Health assessment of our district and actually we need to do one of our entire community and the other thing I wanted to say is just sharing something

[01:45:00]
we started out with and I was so moved by the young fifth grader who you know is already starting out and is having an opportunity be in a shared leadership opportunity and a shared decision-making opportunity to help address issues and concerns and I think that's what this is all about tonight

[01:46:00]
the teachers from Albuquerque higher asking for an opportunity to be engaged and have that opportunity to be our partners around a shared decision-making that is going to impact their school their culture and their jobs the places that they work and how many of us really like that kind of opportunity when it's given to us to to express our concerns or express our ideas about what we think is best and for the students at El Dorado you know I can remember when I first started working with the Department of Health and we had the suicide prevention work that came to our state so that we could start to address that what's really frustrating and I learned a new word today so I could turn my frustration into Fascination but my fascination with that is that in our state we continue to have serious issues with suicide and our young people and in our state we still continue to really weigh

[01:47:00]
find activities that we need to support that whether it's Community Mental Health or whether it's the school support services that we need like school-based Health Centers crisis counselor School nurses Etc what I want to do is I think we need to continue to keep the faith in terms of what we need to do I know when we first started with the Department of Health and the suicide prevention work that we were doing we were responding to so many communities that had a number of crises like this where there was six or several and and when I look at that and I was hearing that like board member Garcia was astounded because that is a Public Health crisis and so we need to figure out how we're engaging with our Public Health Community to support APS in the issue because this isn't something that APS can do alone it isn't anything that El Dorado Community can do alone however what I do want to say to is that there is a great promising

[01:48:00]
practice out there and you're already starting it and that's called natural helpers you've already got a group of Youth at your school that already engaged that want to be part of the solution and I think we need to we need to bank on that we need to build on the momentum of those students who want to be part of the solution and in a natural helpers approach we take Natural leaders at the schools such as the leaders that were here tonight who can also help to become the eyes and ears of the students who can also become natural referral sources and mechanisms so that we can get young people who are in crisis at the right door because nine times out of ten a young person is going to approach a young person first and they do that regular I'm seeing the heads from our students so let's take a look at that approach and see if there's something that we can do there I just I know that it can be done I've seen some tremendous changes in a lot of other communities

[01:49:00]
are similar crisis were occurring and it was done we didn't have to have a school-based health center although having a school-based health center would be lovely I wish we could have more of those across the state across the city everyone knows I'm really committed to that process they're not easy to implement but you know how do we do that how do we get our our crisis Community also our Mental Health Community to be a partner with you as you're trying to address your concerns so and also for the budget cut issues it's also a shared leadership issue it's also shared decision making we have to look really hard at some of the impact of the decisions that we're making when budgets are being squeezed or things are happening what are those impacts that are going to happen that we just don't maybe we just don't see right away so thank you for coming and sharing what you see is some of those impacts are going to be because we need to take those into account because there are going to be students down the line that are probably going to be impacted

[01:50:00]
negatively and we don't want to have that either but how can we do this together in times of budget cuts because that's also what's happening it's not an easy decision but I think if we get together with our communities and have some real shared leadership and shared decision-making I think we might be able to to resolve some of our issues thank you thank you I do appreciate the volunteers I was amazed it was lovely to see Mr jewelry for all of us and the others were amazing so thank you for bringing them to our attention this evening to the Albuquerque High teachers thank you

[01:51:00]
It's tricky sometimes for us to hear things in part because it's difficult to try to welcome what may seem like criticism I think that we are on the same team so to speak I think that we have very similar if not consistent values and I would hope that there's some way to engage you to be part of the process the ultimate decision of course is the superintendents in terms of firing and all that good stuff but I think the more we can strive to be

[01:52:00]
Democratic and inclusive organization the better organizational culture will get but it also means that we have to listen to points of view that are different from ours and so my hope is that we will continue to learn how to do that because I don't know that we're all very good at that the the students I want to thank you for your leadership

[01:53:00]
I really think that survey needs to be Geo mapped so we know what's happening in what parts of the city we've had a leadership problem in that public health in my opinion has really been watered down and destroyed in our state that's my opinion I worked there for 12 years so I know a little bit about it but I'm certainly not an expert and Mr leave us thank you for coming I appreciate from a neighborhood association perspective to come in and share what you're thinking I want to tell you don't always believe what you read in the newspaper or what you hear I don't believe we have the schools and F schools I think we have schools that are struggling and they have to do with the fact that we have been consistently underfunded for years we've been undermined we've been criticized we've been teachers have been badmouth and labels

[01:54:00]
as failing teachers and now we have this process where schools have been labeled as well and there's some idea that those school grades have credibility will affect the matter is you can't replicate the formula you can't explain the formula as to how they get those grades and certainly teacher evaluations we're still hoping that at some point the judge will share some perspective on that court case in the newspaper but I have to tell you that we are in a fight for public health for public education public health for many many things that we took for granted during the days of the war on poverty when we were building these things when I was a young

[01:55:00]
and the truth is I think we have to keep fighting to get back on track I'm concerned about us as a district I'm concerned about us as an organization and I hope that organizational culture is something that we really look at and we figure out the measures that we can agree we want to look at in order to to move us forward as a district thank you thank you decision I just

[01:56:00]
really want to point out that that is a charter school issue that the charter school is the one that entered into this agreement and one of the things I would love to have an investigative reporter really do some research into the deals that are made between the charter schools and landowners because there are some real concerns there so the purchase of that property probably is not something that we would have dreamed up ourselves but it's trying to make the least bad situation that we possibly can with the situation that was out of our hands in the first place and so that's why I get really frustrated with this this message the story that comes out about failing schools because look at who was here tonight period

[01:57:00]
focused absolutely knowing not just the whole academic thing of how do you of what's going on but being vested in the community and here to to speak their mind and make their call teachers from Albuquerque High I mean I would I would challenge anyone to say that we don't have amazing teachers and and the fact that teachers are vested to come and participate in this way and I do I am curious because we used to have really was a procedure for principal selection that guarantee there's there's voices of certified folks and so just making sure that that procedure is followed because I know that there has been one in place so we we need to make sure that

[01:58:00]
mental health you know I think the district is phenomenal and does a really good job at the kinds of Crisis Intervention when it comes to when I mean when we had I know when I was teaching if we had a child who is making suicidal ideations it was addressed automatically but the problem is and I think that serve at the heart of what the concerns from the Eldorado students are is that it takes relationship it takes trust and that means more than just that Crisis Intervention I mean Crisis Intervention is not bad at all but there needs to be the kind of counseling that isn't just focused but that really and every every every every every school needs that kind of

[01:59:00]
the other part of this meeting tonight that I think is impressive when you saw that that line of volunteers the National Merit Scholarship of semi-finalists all those folks really illustrate how we come together as a district I think in really incredible ways to support each other to make good things happen I'm sorry I don't want it to sound like when every time I start harping on the budget I don't want to make it sound like I'm making excuses and again I want to thank the especially Dr Gonzalez and Dr Blakey for the work that's been done around MRI schools in the kind of collaboration that is because I think that's really a sign of how do we grow voice how do we how

[02:00:00]
be inclusive how do we create the kinds of collaborative situations that we know will be best for staff for families for students so we have we have things that we know how to do we have things that we're doing well and the problem is you know I we don't fun schools based on what schools need because if we funded schools based on the way that they should be funded and I apologize because this is my soapbox period the way that our students our children deserve to have them funded we would say every single School needs the kind of career counselor testing whatever that most counselors end up having to pick up the slack for but every school would also have a therapeutic counselor who really

[02:01:00]
play focus is on developing the relationships with students that are needed we'd have a social worker in if not every school in every school that indicates I need we would have a community school and absolutely every single school because that's the kind of organization structure that we're trying to grow and build and we are doing it well in some schools but it's not in every school and it should be every school would have a librarian every school would have the music and the art and all of those folks we have that got paid a living wage and we have teachers who are you know on the kind of but we don't like that we have a good formula for what it is but it's a division formula it's not a multiplying for you it's a division formula that says how much money is this state willing to pay for education and then

[02:02:00]
divide it up and somehow we'll figure out how to best needs so are per unit funding which is not exactly equal to every student because some students you know special ed kids are worth more than one unit kindergarten kids might be more than one unit I think 4th grade regular and General Ed on track kid is one unit and most kids spend somewhere in between but that funding for that child that normal child is 4,084,000 this District spends 0.8% of its Budget on most of the people who are sitting in here tonight

[02:03:00]
.8 of the budget thank you just want to make sure we get that right we're talking for percentage not dollars 80 okay anyway less than 1% on the people sitting in here that this is The Purge that we made many years ago 20008 enrollment has gone down in the only reason why I bring this up every time is to say when people come with needs their rights aren't being met we are scrambling

[02:04:00]
I want to do the best we can but it's not because our schools are failing when one quick thing I know someone did it one teacher at an elementary school did a calculation if they have 11 students opt out that one of my schools their school grade will go down a grade so we're talking small numbers I think the point is this is really a call to action and it's why I really appreciate everyone who is here because we are in this together some decisions we can make better inside of the district some decisions we need help with at other levels and we need to make that call to Santa Fe we need we need to call on our legislature to fun schools the way that they really should be funded and we need help getting the story out about how are schools

[02:05:00]
what do we do well and it's and that's not to say that there aren't things where we dropped the ball and we need to hear from the community when we drop the ball but as a whole I look at it and again tonight's meeting all of those all of those folks who were lined up at the wall all the folks here I think it's an indication we're not a failing District do we have things we need to deal with yes and we need to do it together and so thank you for being here thank you how long do I have first of all to the students that are still here and to the ones that left you make sure to pass it on to them you are empowered you have the power to

[02:06:00]
Play Changes it is in your hands and we are here to help you to do whatever we can to make things better for students that are in dire situations that are thinking that their life isn't worth that their life is worth it to me and to I know everybody else on the board you guys matter you're what tomorrow is your what I look forward to so I know that we for sure don't I think if we did an audit of mental health services at APS and probably across the country that audit would show that we are lacking we don't have what we need to help you and I am so sorry for that but I want you to know that together we need to form Partnerships with the city with the county with the state

[02:07:00]
because the county does have a tax that is recurring that is going to be used to help with mental health and that means you all live in the county so that is there to help you guys to help your friends so know that take that knowledge with you I don't want anybody I know somebody said that we've been silent I want you to know that we really haven't been if I could have a psychologist in every school we would all want that we've asked for social workers in every school we've asked for that we want that I promise that is what we want and I know that would that would help with itself everything I don't know that it would but I know that it would help I know somebody said that they felt defeated and that really makes me really sad I want you to feel that you all can do everything

[02:08:00]
don't feel defeated know that we are here to help you however we possibly can I know words are not going to help help help you cope with some things and I know that only actions will so I want to make sure that our budget shows that you guys are number one your lives are worth it and I hope that our budget will show that I know this year might be a little bit more difficult because we're so far in but I want to hope that next year that we will be able to do more to try to get that Mental Health Services out in as many schools as we possibly can tomorrow is bright it is it's a sad last Sunday was a sad day but we have tomorrow and we have the next day so do what you can to make

[02:09:00]
is happy for people and listen to them and let people know if you hear something that's the only way that we're going to stop things pass it on cuz they are going to be talking to you rather a lot of times in coming to to adults and I think to Eric we should put resources in a school rather than take it away I know that's devastating to schools and I always say if I ever want the lottery and one billions of dollars I know where it would go into Albuquerque High I mean I do want to ask this question that hiring committee do you all feel or superintendent reading that you're not represented well on that committee is that if I can just get a nod from you that you are not represented well on that committee you don't have as many people on their as you would like

[02:10:00]
please let us know what else I think that you should have as much say as is allowed I know the superintendent is the one who makes the final decision when it comes to hiring but your voice is should should be heard I think they should be heard I remember when I was a teacher and we got to sit on committees when we were going to be hiring a new principal and I felt my voice was my voice was always heard I'm sorry if you feel that yours isn't I hope we can make that right and to our volunteers it was I'll remember one a blind date with a book I think I've had a lot of those so I thought that was just wonderful our volunteers are just are just fabulous and to Dr

[02:11:00]
just getting all those kids to eat their vegetables and I think that's a that's a great thing I also wanted to extend prayers to the Reardon family to Michael and to to their two children I know Jennifer Riordan had great faith and I know that faith has has led her to her to her Eternal home but her family is is Left Behind so our prayers need to be with them so I think that's it thank you have a good night thank you very much I spent about

[02:12:00]
how far is this afternoon writing up about 11:00 double-sided and I'm not going to talk to those points I realized that nobody here wants to hear what I had to say about that but I will address this couple things the bike this family is actually lives about a block away from me or less than a block away from me and so I was personally aware of of the support today I was very impressed with the memorial service we have the church

[02:13:00]
from all across the district Manzano El Dorado La Cueva Valley all kinds of different high schools just got here I think they were all there and so the students here who expressed their thoughts about the mental health and issues very appropriate very appropriate and I and I think again what I'd like you to understand and take back to your students is that we are addressing a lot of those things we that's the superintendent said we have a 1000 conversations we would like to have more resources for the mental health we'd like to have more capabilities to address that issue at the root causes of

[02:14:00]
address to systemic things that are problems for our kids problems for adults the mental health things and why are we having these issues that's really the issue I mean we're addressing it from the point of view when we somebody comes to us but that's that's a lot of times pretty late and even if they do come to us sometimes they don't come to us so I really appreciate the comments about having you students being some of the eyes and ears you are on the floor you you do talk with your own students it's really really important for you to talk and to be able to know how to take that information into communicate that with somebody who may be able to get them some help from a nurse and you don't know sometimes you say well I heard that but I'm not too sure

[02:15:00]
don't be too sure just go and say hey I think there may be an issue can somebody address this and maybe maybe there's a chance there to prevent a few things I appreciate also my Albuquerque hi folks I think it's again important for you guys to be involved but again I want you to understand too is the principal's not just for your school even though that is primary thing for a principal but they also interface with all of our Administration and so there's this connectivity here that has to be there so there's a partnership here that has to be there in that and I think you guys have a major part of that I think that the parents maybe have a good part of that and I think again the ministration has a part of that so work on that collaboration and I and I'm pretty sure that the administration is going to make sure that happens you know so again I may not be exactly how you guys stated it with your demand but it's it's okay I think again you know you got to start somewhere right

[02:16:00]
and so I think that's certainly something that's going to happen well for you and and all the best Albuquerque High I mean they are foundation for our for our high school here in Albuquerque right now that's why you call them now because I guess right so anyway I think that's going to be a big deal one thing I would bring out I did go to the art of Education any given child event this last Sunday and I did reflect a little on on the Arts in education

[02:17:00]
cuz I wanted to tell myself what is it that we're doing here in APS I mean there are just tons of things that we're doing guys tons of magnet schools we've got family schools we've got you know engagement with our communities we've got you know bilingual programs we got eight people programs you've got magnet schools we got everything in the world going on here are you doing and we are making improvements guys we are making improvements we've got a lot of things that are improving and we got great results in many different areas and so I just wanted to say I don't know any other District in the state that does all things we've got great

[02:18:00]
we got a great academic master plan we've got rewards from all the national organizations in terms of the things that we've got going so when we're looking at our MRI schools and we're looking at things like the genius hour is an example of Art and education it's an example of Applied academics which is what our kids need experiential learning it's exactly the kind of thing that's going to help our kids I am really proud of the fact that this framework I think can be used for many of our other schools and so

[02:19:00]
can you put together a lot of time and effort in our staff to make sure that that can happen and that we can actually sustain what we're doing in those schools as well as leverage it in terms of scaling it to other schools and I can guarantee you that we're not going to let anyone take over our schools so I hope that those plans are proof summary you know I'm really proud to be a small part of this great public school organization that I think are part of this organization I want to say thanks I want to say keep the faith and don't worry about getting credit because our students are going to carry on the credit

[02:20:00]
for years to come and I'm looking forward to the wonderful year end events that are going to happen here to highlight all the accomplishments of our students not the least of which are all the graduations so thank you very much and with that the announcement of that Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday May 2nd 5:00 here and the next special Board of Education meeting will be Monday April 23rd in the Dell Martin
