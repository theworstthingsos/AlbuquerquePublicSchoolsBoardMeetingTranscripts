==================================================

[00:00:00]
remember the name is we are streaming all right thank you mister Gonzales good Monday afternoon to all who are in attendance and participants thank you for joining us and I want to thank those constituents and guests who are returning for your continued engagement and commitment to Public Schools I'm promising to work hard to keep this meeting under an hour an hour Max and and so I asked for for the cooperation of fellow committee members

[00:01:00]
but I certainly don't want to hamper discussion but just a reminder that we did get materials ahead of time everyone had a chance to ask questions and I am looking forward to some good discussion so I will I would like to call this meeting to order Dr Albright may I please have a roll call Courtney Jackson Tennessee to consider adoption of the November 4th 2024 policy committee meeting agenda may I have a motion and a second please

[00:02:00]
the I moved to adopt the November 4th 2024 policy committee meeting agenda I was second place of the minutes from the policy committee meeting on September 9th 2024 may I have a motion in the second please I moved to approve the minutes from the policy committee meeting on September 9th Hotel Jackson

[00:03:00]
yes our next item for consideration in action is approval of amendments to sections for I 4J and 4K of the aps Board of Education governance manual may I have a motion in a second please I moved to prove the amendments to sections for the aps Board of Education governance manual and I will talk and may we have a call cuz you have emotions

[00:04:00]
so is there a discussion on the item yes I have some discussion board member Jackson so my first question is in regards to the additional amendment that was inserted into the committee meeting committee minutes for 4:18 or the language was changed from what was the proposed language from the first reading I'm wondering why it was changed why the committee isn't going to discuss the change of the language but also the fact that there's potentially unintended consequences that come up with this where the language was changed by the chairs discretion to be an additional Committee Member may choose to participate on a row

[00:05:00]
it doesn't really have any guardrails or parameters around it what if what if all four of us want to show up to agenda meetings what I mean where where where where where the where are the guidelines around any additional Committee Member may choose to participate on a rotating basis cozy intent the original intent that we discussed during the last committee meeting was to was around transparency I don't think it's a good idea to have one person the chair of any committee meeting with the superintendent alone I think it's wise to have another member present but it also serves for onboarding

[00:06:00]
sing and Leadership capacity building it keeps people in the loop if you can see how conversations happen with leadership it makes it easier for board members to step into those roles so I want to clarify that the original when I saw the the written language present that sentence did not capture the essence of encouraging participation because it puts all the power in one person the chair the chairman participation I think it's important to

[00:07:00]
how members to make it clear that an additional Committee Member may choose to participate as long as it's on a rotating basis thereby giving other committee members an opportunity to see how committee agendas are set and so that's the intent behind I think that was the intent at the of the conversation of how I frame the conversation at the last meeting and so I asked our policy analyst to have the language reflect intent I don't think there's any you can only have one additional person in that committee or in that agenda setting meeting I think

[00:08:00]
the decision should not rest in one person's one person's the chairs decision it shouldn't should not block access and there's a potential for that well I guess I think you're right there are consequences so my question is is let's say for sake of argument that both Ronaldo and I decided that we want to show up to the next committee meeting I mean who makes those decisions you know it's it's like who gets to decide whether it's me or it's Ronaldo and then if we both decide we want to come like do you see like it's it's creating unintended consequences of who gets to choose to participate fair question

[00:09:00]
does anyone else want to board member Tom burrito or board member Astoria do you want to weigh in on this yeah I can we and this is where I I see both points of you so I do I do see the intent that we wanted to come through with that first change which I do agree with and I do like the the sentiment of wanting to learn and this being like a learning space for each Committee Member and I also do see board member Jackson's worry when it comes to what does happen if multiple board members want or bored committee members want to attend those meetings so yeah I'm trying to word it in my head as well I don't know remember to Marie has anything she wants to jump in

[00:10:00]
I am right now we're currently sits and I know that you know like for instance like right now we have how many board members attending the committee meeting and then and then other places we have our designated to so it works based on whatever the familiarity for those board members to want to participate I think even with audit there's two of us that's Heather and I and sometimes you know Courtney comes into and but there is that question of because there's only seven of us and how we run this whole thing but I understand how would we choose like let's go back to board member Jackson's example for it if you and she want to join me

[00:11:00]
848 committee or an agenda setting meeting with the superintendent how would you to resolve that I mean is it I guess that's my question like why I if this is being inserted for for a reason dot this committee thinks is important then shouldn't it also have guidelines as to how that situation is resolved we can do that why why why why why why why why did I have to rock paper scissors as to who gets to go instead of their if we're creating a document that's our guidance document then shouldn't it have guidance in it so kind of My overall question of this too is which is going to become a recurring theme

[00:12:00]
is this is part of the governance manual right this is in our government's manual and on November 20th we are going to be having a meeting where we're going to be discussing the implementation calendar the implementation and Outlook that we're going to have and in that we're going to be conducting an advert there's an ad hoc committee is going to be established to review the entire governance manual so an overall theme that I'm you're going to pick up on tonight is I guess I don't understand why we're doing such small changes when the whole governance manual is about to be reviewed by an ad hoc committee guess my question is who decided that we all had an opportunity to review the the implementation calendar

[00:13:00]
we've all had conversations with our coaches and those that's going to be discussed on November 20th correct and that will be discussed right so if we're about to have an entire government's manual review and just uncomfortable with us making all of these changes when we're just about to go through the process for a second time it just seems inefficient this is the other thing Courtney you have to realize is that one we got adopt that timeline and that that particular piece but there's also some of us who disagree with it and I don't want to also state that we are going to do that in the future when one if there's disagreement with

[00:14:00]
timeline I think that's another thing that once we discussed that then we can feel appropriately that we do need to take action based on what we agree with but I think right now once that comes into our direction of voting on it that will then you know what we need to do but I think right now the question is there's some of us who disagree with that it seems like stuff like this needs to go to the full board I know that there's precedence for certain things in that when we I don't really think too this is where we have to really decide one is this up to policy committee or is it up to board and you're saying it's up to board but I

[00:15:00]
Sophia I don't know based on the direction of how we want to proceed in this is Boston but it's also one of the questions of if we choose to go that route or if we choose to do this within the policy committee is another question well I think even if it is within the policy committee all that committees can do is make recommendations to the full board yeah go even if you know that we are 100% going to have disagreements about all of these changes amendments that have been put forth for tonight all we can do is record either recommend or not recommend the changes it is going to have to go to the full board and the full board is going to have to decide so I I will make my make my statements and and reflect on the fact that you know we're ultimately trying to create a culture of changing adult behaviors and it seems like

[00:16:00]
a lot of these changes are being made for the benefit of the adults and is taking time away from focusing on what we really need to be focusing on which is students and the fact that you know 25 hours has been spent just on these small changes it's just mind-boggling that so much of our staff time is being taken up to nitpick policies that are adult focused and not student-centered Courtney and I'm only saying this because I think that one I brought up the question many times on the dice about adult behaviors and how do we evaluate that and nobody has even begun to cite how we'll do that and I think right now what we're seeing at play here is

[00:17:00]
numerous adult behavior is not only specifically on the board and I'm going to be truthful with that and I know how do you quantify and change that direction so all of us have an equal part and an equal voice sitting on this board because I do feel at times that that that that is not the focus here and we've lost sight of that so I think adult behaviors yes are in question and I think right now we need to figure out how we evaluate it and look at that thank you about the the amendment or the second read and I still feel like both reasons I guess makes sense to me and I do think if we do have like some parameter on there about having one additional Committee Member

[00:18:00]
choose to participate on a rotating basis because I do think choose to participate is important to keep in there because I do understand what you're saying about chair having that decision but I also do think that it comes with the rule if you choose to become chair you have to make those decisions right and that's where it gets money remember Jackson is talking about like who how do we decide those things so in this being a guy we can say right you the chairman create some type of rotating basis for each participant or something like that but I do I do understand that there has to be some type of parameters because we can't have the same participant wanting to attend a meeting every single time but yeah I just wanted to bring us back because I know where the menus you want to stay on time yes thank you I appreciate that and so I was you know I'm I'm trying to understand the problem here

[00:19:00]
I mean we can add on a rotating basis dictated by alphabetical order it's that simple I think I think my point of this is that these additions are creating unintended consequences when that that haven't been clearly thought through so if if if it seems like for the the committee to leave it as this and then this can go to the full board and the discussion can be had there that's fine I'm just I'm pointing out that these changes I'm not sure that they've been through all the way and then I have another and then I have another question but if we want to move to the next one so you know we're putting together a handbook an addendum guidelines

[00:20:00]
and so we can we can certainly note how this will happen in that addendum in that in those the addendum on processes that does that sound like a reasonable for the information to be shifted into the background I did ask the question is why that language that had already been removed from the we we discussed that language last time and it was removed and so it seemed

[00:21:00]
so it has made its way back into the the governance manual even though it has already been removed and my the question when it came back is the answer was that you was the chair had reinserted it so the points that I feel compelled to make about that is first of all I think it's a little disrespectful that after this committee has decided that that language needed to be removed that it got placed back in again we will be discussing and implementation calendar on November 20th in which issues like that about when the governance manual needs to be reviewed how often it needs to be reviewed all of that is going to be or can be discussed through the ad hoc committee that is doing the job of reviewing the government's manual I also

[00:22:00]
I will go on record I hate this statement I think it I think it has the potential for abuse I think it has the huge potential for ineffective governance I think it creates a pass in which stability of our governance manual is reduced because our government's manual is meant to be are like are solid or road map right like this we that we rely on and if we can if it can just be changed at a whim or if we're going to be spending our time wordsmithing policies or making little you know changes here and there just because there has to be continuous review and revision it's just starting us

[00:23:00]
Cast Away from effective governance and down a path where we are completely redirecting ourselves away from focusing on the student outcomes so for the record I would like that language removed because it was removed the first time and it has strangely made its way back in so I'd like to answer to that first of all I think yes there's going to be a review of the manual but we are still a committee and we still have the right to and and the obligation to do the work of policy committee and I want to remind our viewers that we are

[00:24:00]
a work in progress this government's manual is still new and it is one of our board members pointed out the student outcomes Focus governance is a framework it doesn't have to be a Bible and so we are an emerging a work in progress an emerging example and so the reason I brought this back is because it did come up in conversation with a couple of board members and and so I felt it necessary to revisit bring it back here to the committee to revisit the language I think it's important to reiterate that

[00:25:00]
and quite frankly I believe the policies even administrative educational policies and and administrative policies are a living document their there were always reviewing and adjusting and because we are the the example supposedly Nationwide I think this is a good example to set that we will our manual will accommodate the board's needs and the implementation of student outcomes Focus governance and I will also reiterate that are Mantra on the board is student outcomes don't change until adult behaviors change and discovers manual

[00:26:00]
helps us as adults it stands as a statement of values and we value transparency we value collaboration we value continuous Improvement and that's what a living document represents and so I will leave it up to the other I'd like to hear from board member Ito briefly and board member remember

[00:27:00]
part of the reason that it was removed was because OK Google part of it was because we were well let me go back part of it is because policy review is already stated in 4J how we go about our policy renewal our policy amendments our policy revision it's already outlined in 4J so which is the board policy scope and development section so having that in first of all having the language in there was redundant it's all so in also listed in 4D where it talks about how the board will comply with all federal statutes

[00:28:00]
discusses the board's primary powers of policy so the main reason that it was removed was because it was fluff when we actually had you know articles that were addressing policy development that I think it was somewhere else or something so yeah I do think because the last committee policy committee meeting we spent a lot of time discussing what should and should not be on there I do agree that I mean if it's already in 4J about how we amend policy I think we could leave it out I will also say that

[00:29:00]
during my one-on-one with our coach and the implementation policy I did have some questions about my role when it comes to governing because I feel like they're like I always say this there's just a misinterpretation of how government spaniel is read so I think it's important that we have these discussions but I also want to make sure that we are writing this document in a way that makes sense and is also I don't know we don't leave anything out right so I understand the need to make sure that we say it is a living policy document but if there's already a section then I don't think we need to have that in the background and we could add something like that to 4J where it talks about those amendments but yeah I will pass it to remember tomorrow I don't yeah that's kind of my opinion on it may I

[00:30:00]
Something board member tomorrow before you make your comments so here's another piece of my thinking when I return from the national Indian Education Association conference what became very very clear to me there was that we had we had failed to consult properly with our tribal leaders on and they had the superintendent of the Navajo Nation articulated his his displeasure with how we had worded our educational policy two of them in particular he noted that we had reference

[00:31:00]
the Martinez Yazzie lawsuit and he was not happy with the president of the Navajo Nation with with the wording on on those two references the targeted populations of the Martinez Yazzie and he had some suggestions but it reminded me as to how new we are at this and it also reminded me that in a historical context the needs of tribal leaders who who are articulating their desire and their respectful demand to be at the table came through loud and clear it isn't it's evolving

[00:32:00]
those conversations around tribal consultation and so I guess this I felt compelled to come back to this notion of a living document and reiterating that in the in our historical Continuum in the state and in Albuquerque it's a good reminder yes we're going to revise I think there's language in for J that is open to interpretation but I wanted to see a more solid expression about this manual being a work in progress being open to collaboration to do justice

[00:33:00]
play Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationships and so I forgot to mention all that backdrop which is what I came back with in my head and trying to honor what I had learned at the national Indian Education Association conference and so I'll stop and board members here in these policies and why and how and I have a question but never gotten answers I understand the reiteration of certain policies and how they're brought up in certain other places

[00:34:00]
but I also know that as a new and incoming board members sometimes this can be confusing when other board members know where these places are while the rest of us are trying to figure out okay this is where it is this is where it's not is and it can become confusing but also reiterated but then reiterated in a different form and so it makes us to question sometimes where do we sit and how do we sit on these certain areas of concern but I think right now I understand in the future we are going to you know whether it depends on when we take on that timeline and how we're going to do it is the question of whether or not how we want to proceed forward but I also understand that we got to give honor due to the policy committee and what it's doing now and I understand

[00:35:00]
come and get some the chair is coming from too and her understanding of many other aspects that we're seeing going on at this moment and the questioning of how we create this voice within Equity is what we're really looking at here to make sure it's fair and right and just for all of us to have the voice and what we need so that this policy is not taken out of contents but I understand everybody's need and I understand the backdrop of everything but I also feel that what we have to do as a policy committee is and is do what we need to now and as we change that down the road then it is changed but I also think that we have to honor this process and do what we need to I don't know if that's an answer we

[00:36:00]
change this language or not so does it suffice to say in 4J the board May develop review and revise any governance policy established by the board through a majority vote of members is that enough I will say that from the prior discussion I think it's important in that where you just stated to say something about the governance manual and amending it in some way because I think that was part of the

[00:37:00]
biggest concerns last time was we do need to review this governance manual right and that's not clear it's not named the policies are it's just as policies on there and governance manuals not actually named so I do think that that's important to point out but again like I stated before we don't need to have it in the background if we have a section that talks about amendments but that would just be my love if we do add in a name the government's manual review would look like this I think that would be helpful for me and where do you see that do you put it in 4J the second sentence or right after the second sentence so it reads 4 J's first sentence says the board will create an adopt educational or governance policies for Albuquerque Public

[00:38:00]
pools in accordance with applicable state law and regulation second sentence the board May develop review and revise any government's policy established by the board through a majority vote of members I mean that that I think right after that we can add what you have here is we understand the governance manual requires continuous revision to accommodate the boards and implementation of students Focus governments okay so I'm going to respectfully disagree that actually doesn't need to be added because we're already if you leave the language the way it is it may develop review and revise any governance policy established by the board through

[00:39:00]
the majority vote of members that gives the action that you guys are requesting Plus in the background section it does say it's it says that the board will focus on and evaluate the most important student outcome issues while delegating administrative and Management Authority to the superintendent so we're already saying that we're going to do that I'm just I think the big point for me is that when we talked about the governance manual that's really where we're pointing how are board governs everything right and it's not this is like the one point where we're not really talking about student outcomes folks governments are talking about our own outcomes as a board at least like for

[00:40:00]
this is our guide for everything so for me needing to review our governance as a board and how we are making sure it's connected to student outcomes is super important so even with this implement this calendar and the momentum right that's one of the things that I brought up is reviewing the governance manual it's we're going to change it if all of a sudden we see that one point of one part of our government's manual isn't actually providing success to student outcomes because we need to change the way we're governing so I think that's why I really want to name it is like this manual is a guide for us and we need to review it and revise it in order to make sure that we're actually doing their job correctly and I hope that I'm explaining that the way I like it's happening in my head I mean this is so this is what I've tried we've had these discussions I've heard I've heard these

[00:41:00]
he is before I think I heard him on the Dias in September when we were asking for a retreat and why the wise and and and and and and and Pryor and so I'm as policy chair I'm trying to do my best to respond to the needs that I hear especially from new members I think those of us who have been part of this the first draft and I do consider this a first iteration of and that's not to dismiss all the hard work and the initial creation but it's new and and so we have both remember

[00:42:00]
Jackson and I were immersed in this for for a year it felt like and so I think hearing from new members is critical and so I have tried to capture your sentiments exactly board member astorga and I agree we could end it at requiring continuous amend the the suggested amendment that has reappeared after continuous review and revision and again all this I don't want to believe this because this is going to go before the entire board again for discussion but I think it's important to have these thoughts discussed on on the dice and so

[00:43:00]
I'm going to suggest that I'm going to take your suggestion board member Astoria and let's see I need the help of our policy analyst I'm hoping his dictating this the board recognizes the government's manual as a living policy document requiring continuous review and revision and that would appear after the second sentence under the heading for policy scope and development I think that is correct is that do you convert policy analyst Jessica

[00:44:00]
starting because we're looking at two different sections here starting with the background piece the 2022 Board of Education shifted this government's priorities and focus to student outcomes we are striking the board recognizes the governance manual as a living policy document subject to continuous review and revision from this section and moving it to 4J after the board May review and revise any government's policy established by the board for majority of the members the board recognizes that the government's manual is a living policy document requiring continuous review and revision is that what you think it's still living policy document part I think it's just well board members I'm taking words out of your mouth that I think all she inserted there was the governance manual will

[00:45:00]
is subject to continuous review and revision board recognizes the government's manual no no no yes so it was just that that second part that I had suggested she said the talking about revisions the board recognizes the government's manual requires continuous review and revision to accommodate and implementation of student outcomes Focus governance so the rest is the same just so that continues that same language before striking as a

[00:46:00]
policy document and requires continuous to accommodate the board's needs and the implementation of student outcomes Focus governance correct because that implies that it's a living document so I think sufficient on 4. 0

[00:47:00]
don't you clarify so we're taking it out of the background yes and moving it to become the third sentence at the beginning I mean I'm sorry at the end of 4J so it will read starting with the second sentence the board made any governance policy established by the board for majority vote the board Mail system revise any policy established that is not specifically by prescribed by federal and state statute for majority vote of the members the board recognizes the governance manual requires continuous review and revision to accommodate the boards needs and so on yes okay got it again my

[00:48:00]
purpose was to accommodate new board members observations and concerns and so yeah I'd like to move on so we need to start taking responsibility for learning what's in our documents okay I think there's room for Grace we have also not done a good job of perfecting the onboarding process and and it requires time to to call us

[00:49:00]
the four previous members with three new members who who are trying to make their way as best as possible and I might add you know the policy committee met with some difficulties getting meetings together and so I'll just leave it at that and I think that because the governance manual trying to learn my role and all of these things and I think what's hard and confusing specifically about the governance manual which I also shared with our coach doing the implementation calendar meeting is that I can read it a certain way but once I try to cover and as a board member I couldn't get with some obstacles barriers right because I'm interpreting the governance manual certain way

[00:50:00]
you can tell me that the government's manual says something completely different than board member Dominguez does so that was one of the biggest reasons why I did want a retreat to really talk about the governance manual itself and its interpretation and I think that's the hardest part for me as a new board member and why I do agree with revising it or not even revising it right just looking at it and see how we're interpreting it because I'm trying to do the best that I can as a new board member and even when I think that sometimes I get it it seems like I don't because I have board members seen it different ways so that's why I see this as like a guide for us as our adult behaviors and governing as board members but it's not clear and I think it's it's not that the wording isn't clear I really do feel like it's two different interpretations and that's what's hard so even in these conversations as we're as we're talking like I said

[00:51:00]
430 things that I do agree with you will remember Jackson and then I do agree with you board member don't mean yes because this is the first time I'm hearing it from different perspectives so I appreciate this setting and I think that's what we've been needing the whole time but yeah it's frustrating because it is month 11:00 and I'm still having the same questions and asking the same questions here in the policy committee meetings and on the diets of what is my role how do I do my role of effectively and I don't get clear answers or when I do it's different from different board members so I'm developing like my own Persona as a board member but it would be great if we're all United and one delivery and I know that that's hard but I think that's that's the purpose of these meetings I think they're having that discussion so I think it's important that that we're all here and I'm being genuine with our opinions which I appreciate you and I do

[00:52:00]
appreciate hearing from new board members because your your experience matters it's a for me it's a okay it's time to redo the lesson plan revisit for me as a teacher it makes a whole lot of sense because you need to stop and and reconfigure so and you're right that's what we're trying to do here and just so quickly add that it's not s o f g like there's no problem with that frame it really is just learning how to be the most effective like elected official in this new way that we're governing coming from someone who has never been in this position before so it really does come from okay how do I learn this in a way where I'm going to

[00:53:00]
United in that same way of delivery which is very much the point that I'm trying to make and I realize that I'm coming across harshly but that that's very much the point I'm trying to make is this document has to help us effectively govern whether it's sosg or some other sort of governance structure we have to continually we have to be focusing on what what this document says so that we're effectively governing so that we're not wasting our time discussing sentence structure we're focusing on counter kids read so that's my point of all of this when I make when I point things out like will that language is already

[00:54:00]
it is because I've studied this document it is because I've read this document but it's also because our job is to be effective governors of the board and so to do that we have to have a document that aids Us in that in that role so that's my and you know and I wanted to also agree with some it is one thing to give us the documents and to give us the books and to give us all those things but when we don't understand and limits of conversations what are you addressing where are you addressing it until you start reading everything but then sometimes within the document it doesn't refer to specific other documents or policies so it becomes very clouded

[00:55:00]
and how you perceive and need to take action on something and I'm only saying that because as an advocate and special education you need to know where those things are written and how they're written and why they're written that way but when it gets confusing then you lose sight of your role and how to Advocate and also your role as a board member that becomes clouded and so then it's but you hear everybody talk to you about staying in your lane but you don't even know what Lane that is but then but then all of a sudden and I'm only trying to be truthful is you get reprimanded or you get told that you went in the wrong way and then you're trying to just guide yourself and try to figure out okay let me take a step back but because we don't know sometimes when we read these documents that also creates a hindrance of not having a voice that all also creates

[00:56:00]
a place where am I an equal board member on this isn't it and if I don't feel that is it because I don't know the documents or are the documents confusing and so it's it is very questionable and I have to agree with board member Astoria and as a new and incoming board member its it is trying to figure out where is our place what is our role but when it's cloudy and and not given to you directly and there's there's these other ideas and questions of what is right and what is it yeah you have a tendency not to say anything you just take a backspace and you try to figure it out and hope we do and that's all I'm going to say on this but it has been one too and yes it took us this long but that's also to say that it's that confusing and to finally figure out what is over here manuals over here policies over here you know

[00:57:00]
and not having the onboarding or not having these Retreat and questions within a retreat it becomes really hard it becomes hard when you're Guided by nothing really to figure this whole thing out but anyway that's all I'm going to say thank you I'm just going to say that at the end of the day honest inquiry into the governance manual to effectively serve our constituents and our board members are new board members and potential board members out in the audience should be welcome and encouraged and that's I'm trying to create a space for that but I'm also trying to be mindful of time and arts and our time is getting away from us and so I'd like to bring this item four to conclusion if that's okay

[00:58:00]
so I think there's still room for discussion because this is this is a recommendation coming out of this committee to the board at large and so there's going to be more discussion about what we decide here so with that I'd like to ask for emotion and a second so that we can get on to the next item on our agenda you have a motion in a second what you actually need is now emotion to amend because there were amendments to the original motion may I have a motion to Amendment

[00:59:00]
sing the recommended Amendment out of the background information let me get my and over to 4J board policy scope in development so tell me if this is correct the Amendments of the amendments to sections for J and 4K of the aps Board of Education governance manual all you need to say is that you move to amend the original motion blah blah blah blah okay I moved to amend the original motion of approval of amendments to section for I of the aps education governance

[01:00:00]
in a second word never tell marito okay Dr Albright may we have a roll call vote please vanilla store yes Ronaldo's number five our next item for consideration is policy review update and next steps and our presenters are board members Courtney Jackson and Heather boards so do you

[01:01:00]
do you want me to do the quick introduction sure if you'd like and good evening everyone so board member benavidez and I sat on the policy at the policy diet at hoc committee we were tasked with reviewing the remainder of the policies that had already been reviewed one time last summer with board president Gonzalez and former board member Barb Petersen so any that were not very clearly administrative or very clearly bored were then put before board member benavidez and myself we reviewed them two separate times so that we could make our recommendations and the one thing that we have is we were reviewing these

[01:02:00]
documents was we always had in the back of her head where does the expertise lie so if the expertise very clearly laid with the superintendent we felt very confident placing those policies into the room number into the archive section if they if we felt that they were very clearly within the expertise of the board that we cut we kept them and then there are some that we feel that we need to keep but they just need a slight modification so board member benefits do you have anything to add that was very comprehensive summary but it was kind of a tough job for one of the newer board members who was still learning and even after 11 months you know there are things that are very puzzling to me but everybody's grace and patience have been wonderful so I appreciate that

[01:03:00]
but it it was a lot of time and effort on our part and we met a few times and I hope that the board agrees with what we have decided or what we concluded with each of the policies that we reviewed and I want to say I really appreciate the effort on on both your parts because I know it takes time and a lot of discussion and and for you board member been of you this you you have a full-time job on top of all that we asked for both and I know you have a full-time job outside the house and board member Jackson and women who

[01:04:00]
rely on to take care of our children at home we have a full-time job at home so thank you to both are there any questions and so just briefly remind me what how you foresee next steps I think Miss Martinez can help us with this but my understanding is that this this is right now just to discussion item and that this recommendation will go to the full board is that correct Miss Martinez and I'm sure remember Jackson yeah that's correct from here the next step can be that for now you all are just sharing your recommendations and your findings and Next Step will be to take the if this committee agrees to take the archive policies to consent calendar and

[01:05:00]
remember that's an option for you any further review can happen at a later time that's good to know what will the keeps go to consent is I guess I guess if they're keeping them they don't need to be moved the modified the the movie for their review potential revision whatever the committee I have do I make a recommendation now for the KB or do I wait until the full board I think that will wait till the actual discussion starts okay okay I'll do it then

[01:06:00]
thank you the actual discussion board now or no no the actual discussion for each individual policy review whoever is looking at those is going to take him a piece at a time bring them to a policy meeting and propose their revisions which you know may include the discussion regarding kby or not and the discussion will ensue at that time so I guess that's my question in terms of next steps we as a policy committee we are going to recommend that the the policies in the column that says keep and policies and under archive will move forward to the full board on a consent calendar and

[01:07:00]
so in this committee as these are policies that need reviewing the ones under modify since these are policies that need to review to be reviewed do they do we as a committee need to make a decision about how we handle these next I mean to me it makes sense since we are the policy committee I think I'll have to defer to Dr Blakey on this one doctor Blakey if you have you know a process that may happen in your discussion with the chair that would not be my purview to tell you how to distribute the work I guess I need a little bit of background because I

[01:08:00]
haven't had a since July 1st a review of these policies what has been the process in the past well it we've used a lot of different steps to be on this one this set and luckily there's only six but this set has undergone every consideration between give one to each person and let them make their own proposal have the committee the the policy committee begin the work of review there's many different steps that are available to the committee at this time so are you saying that in last year when they did this they did it different each time they did it different in the sense that we were just going by scores in terms of archive

[01:09:00]
the ones that were kept or modified were really not in a batch like this they were kind of on a case-by-case basis and done by the policy committee so yeah if we stayed with the way that it's been and treat these policies the way that we've treated others then they can go to the policy committee and go one by one for a discussion like you've had tonight and do your you know make your revisions for proposal to the board that way for the and you're talking about the modified section just just the ones in the middle one two three four five six there's no action needed on the keys because those we are keeping up to do anything archives can go on consent the only thing we need to figure out what to do with how to treat the modified policies so I'm going to go back to the

[01:10:00]
play the ad hoc committee members I know you have put in extensive time on this would you want to continue with the 6th with the work of of of of of of continuing the work to figure out what to do with those six or would you rather pass it off to share share the wealth I think that the way the ad hoc committee works is that when we concluded our review of the diet and got to this section that the policy diet has the policy diet has already been expanded because we

[01:11:00]
did our work so and I I will not speak for board member Benavides I'm happy to continue with you know with the modification because she and I have sorry not trying to speak for you I'm happy to continue with the work because I've already done the work but because it's an ad hoc committee that's not a decision for this policy committee that's a decision for the board president who appoints the ad hoc committees yes and and thank you I recognized that you're the ad hoc committee has completed its work and so now we are this committee is faced with a decision so we can either

[01:12:00]
and this is another learning opportunity to to talk about what the policy diet was and how we got to this point and we can certainly use the the wealth of information that both board member Benavides and Jackson bring to the learning process see it as an onboarding that was overlooked perhaps and then we can so this committee can decide what to do with each of those six policies to look at

[01:13:00]
6 then that would go to the pool able to have an ad hoc to look for to the 6th and then bring those recommendations back to the policy committee if we go the ad hoc committee route with our time and I don't mean tonight but our time overall that's kind of what we already did Courtney and I so if you send it to another ad hoc committee it's just having another review which is fine if that's what the the committee decides to do but I think a better use of our time would be for us to explain and probably not right now because I didn't factor in you know being here this long and I apologize for that it's my fault but maybe having a open conversation about how we came to the conclusion we did

[01:14:00]
depending on what the policy committee decides but I think sending what we've decided to another ad hoc committee is just kind of like redundant and please tell me if you disagree to review it right now well I didn't hear what you said I would like to but I don't have the time I'm sorry and that's my fault I didn't realize that this might be a possibility so I didn't factor in the time but I think that's sending it to another ad hoc committee has redundant because we've already done that work and so I think having a discussion about each modification is probably a better use of the time and then the policy committee but that means scheduling another meeting and we have another

[01:15:00]
we have another policy committee meeting set for December 4th is that you know currently I believe the only thing on that agenda Miss Martinez is remind me I think it's only the RFI I know RFI is on the agenda but it also just occurred to me that there are not documents prepared for us to do a review now we would still have to know if she knows the answer to this but I do feel like it was for sure we've got second read on 4-H coming up in December and make a recommendation then and I think I'm capturing what number benavidez is the same she and I already did this so

[01:16:00]
it would make sense if we have the word president reinstate the policy diet at hoc committee she and I can come up with modifications to present when necessary and then that way because we've already done it we've already looked at it we've already made the recommendations of how we what modifications we think need to be there she and I can work on it we can probably not get out pretty quickly and then we can make the recommendations but we would need we would need the board president to reinstate the policy at policy diet at hoc committee so from this committee the recommendation would be to put on consent the keep and the archive with the recommendation

[01:17:00]
with the recommendation to the board president that she reinstate the ad hoc Committee of the policy review diet to address the modifications and you'll do your work continue the work and present but perhaps January or February policy committee is that what am I hearing that sounds like my recommendation I don't know I mean the other thing not to get technical but remember benavidez isn't technically a policy Committee Member so it would have to be through an ad hoc if she and I continue to work together so like she and I can't work together out of the policy Committee just to be technical so yes I think that works for me but I don't know if that works for number benavidez it

[01:18:00]
thank you I think that's a great idea very good okay are we are we finished can we move on to the next item so our next item for consideration is the first read of proposed amendments to section 4 of the aps Board of Education governance manual and you all have an opportunity to get there in November of 2023 the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education adopted its governance manual which incorporates the boards delegation and governing policies

[01:19:00]
committee has now been asked to consider amendments to section 4-H of the manual related to officer roles and responsibilities this is the first read of the proposed changes proposed amendments reviewed by the committee will be posted for 30 days for public comment then return to the committee for possible action and again I just want to reiterate that the thinking Behind These amendments were emerged out of several conversations and a desire to promote transparency to promote more onboarding and a more efficient use of every meeting possible it's also an effort to democratize decisions and to ensure that

[01:20:00]
we are doing a good job of including all elected officials or as many as possible but perspectives and so with that I will open it up to discussion OK Google at least two members of the executive committee will and then 832 some of the concerns that I do have is on letter D and E just because it says that at least two members of the committee

[01:21:00]
Glee with the counts of great City schools and the superintendent I really don't think that that's realistic because it's hard for executive committee to have all three members at the meetings sometimes so having weekly meetings is going to be kind of unrealistic especially because as you mentioned before we do most of us have full-time jobs so I'm thinking that that I don't know how board members from real feels because I know she's also on executive committee but just from my standpoint I feel like that's going to be very difficult to achieve so that was one of the things that I wanted to discuss and then it's kind of like the same issue that I had with 3B with at least two members of executive committee I feel like that's going to be hard to do as well so you know that at least one one other member of the community would work but just along that

[01:22:00]
main lines of it's not super realistic to have all members at those meetings at all times you're reading that to me all members so for the first one right number three letters d and e it just says we need two members of the executive committee to meet weekly with the council great City schools and the superintendent and I feel like that's going to be difficult to do because it's going to be just as with meeting weekly is going to be hard and then that same sentiment that I have about having multiple executive committee members you can correct me if this was a different interpretation but where it says number four be the president will coordinate board approve activities and in collaboration with at least the two members of the executive committee

[01:23:00]
we could put with at least one other member of the executive committee just because again it might be hard to always have all of us outside of the executive committee meetings but I also want to defer to remember to Marie till she feels the same thing I think that I agreed it can be cumbersome and I think that one if we were made aware of and have the opportunity to attend you know that would be great but I think at times we're not aware as executive committee but if we were informed of when those times were and the door was open for us to come I think that if we had you know the means and the time to do it I think that would be a better Avenue because our schedules do change and but I think it's also one just to know that if those

[01:24:00]
meetings are occurring and and if we have the ability to attend then we can you know at least the door is open you know that's all that's how I see it so how can we work toward that end what's what's the the language that we can I agree to me it's about transparency about participation participation of the executive committee are here but you can confirm but my understanding is that you guys are on the calendar Thursday about what it is that you guys

[01:25:00]
the executive committee is like is there a document or something so that you guys always know what's going on and what it is that you guys are discussing in those monthly meetings that you that you guys have yes yes we have monthly meetings and there's always an agenda that we know before it's like a Google doc so we can go and add if we have anything to add and it's like a running list of things that we need to do or that we want the board to know so we do have those procedures in place as executive committee but I do think that some of these things that were changed were really because we don't want just one person to know everything that's happening when we could have an executive committee have knowing more so an example is like the legislative matters right

[01:26:00]
it would be nice to have at least two members there talking about the legislature about board initiatives just because we want that transparency like board member Dominguez was saying but I'm more concerned about is that if we put something in there just to this point that I was making that says that at least two members will do this thing then it might make it hard for the president to do it herself if not one of us of the executive committee are available so just to go back to the suggestion that we could do is reinstate the president will and then i n j keep those ones and then we can just add with the possibility for another executive committee member to attend or something along those lines and said of making its own specified like rule I guess I'm

[01:27:00]
but I'm sitting back and waiting until so I don't jump right in and how I board member and I liked I liked how you I mean your point was to not close the door on the participation of other executive committee members when when possible right well it's just one of knowing the schedule of when those are are going on and if we had the opportunity to attend that we could

[01:28:00]
and that there is an Open Door for that to happen I think sometimes even within our monthly executive meetings there's still some things that do go on that we're not inform of it's just processes and how things are working on the outside beyond our executive meetings and sometimes it's one to get the question of how did it come about what was going on so many times is an executive committee it's one to be helpful that we are aware of how processes going on and is being too new board members and how this all works was like oh okay how do we do that and yes we have an agenda but then it's also wanted to say is it fully representing what needs to happen or is it a teaching experience also for us as brand new people that we understand fully what the executive committee does do

[01:29:00]
but I think that open door would be grateful and just knowing those scheduled meetings that were aware of and we can come at any time if we choose to so what it's so if we were to add the president will attend and I'm referencing I3 I think no I'm referencing for document so the president will attend weekly meetings with the Council of great City Schools or other National entities that unites boards and superintendents on students with an open invitation to executive committee members at all times and the same thing

[01:30:00]
you know the president will meet with the superintendent weekly comma with an open invitation to executive committee members at all times does that sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry we always have to ask whether or not this policy is enabling the board to effectively conduct its business while aligning what it is saying with what it is doing I went and looked at I just pulled four random New Mexico School Board Association boards

[01:31:00]
to see what how they conducted their board officer role in responsibilities not one of them it was Farmington Santa Fe Cuba and Las Cruces not one of them dilutes or change the role of the president the role of the vice president and the role of the secretary to what this is attempting to do the way I read this policy what does policy is attempting to do is to essentially to create to turn the board chair in the board president into like a group project to create all of the decisions having to be made by two or three people and so when I have to ask myself

[01:32:00]
how is this aligning with us being effective what is actually doing is it's going to slow down our ability to take action not sorry not our ability the the executive committee the the governing side of this it's going to substantially slow down the ability to take action I don't understand how this makes the board work more functional and I think from a from an effective governance argument when we look at what are documents say we essentially have a chief education officer who is our superintendent and we have a chief governance officer who is

[01:33:00]
and when we think about our policies that say that we delegate authority to the superintendent when we do that we give the superintendent the ability to make any reasonable interpretation that she sees fit when she's implementing policies will that exact same Theory applies to the board president the board president or the board chair or however we want to call it is essentially our lead governance officer and so we we as words other boards I mean 99.99 percent of boards have one board president who is in charge of all of the things that we previously had listed so we give that governance officer the ability to make interpretations sometimes

[01:34:00]
so that she or he can best take action and I'm really concerned that that interpretation that effective governance is going to be slowed down it could be problematic and potentially chaotic if we're always having to find two people to agree with each other and how we're going to move forward on things sometimes we just need one person to make the decision and when I was thinking through this I was thinking of like Dr Blakey we've delegated to Dr Blakey she's the one person to make decisions but what if we told her you know what doctor Blakey we want you to bring us something about the budget but we also want the Chief Financial Officer to bring us something if we delegated that to two separate people we've now doubled the inefficiencies of how the district works and I

[01:35:00]
we have to be mindful of adjusting policies based on personalities instead of again focusing on how can we be most effective how can we govern so that we're spending our time focusing on goals one through four guardrails one through five and I think that honestly all of these amendments I all of them they don't align with anything that any other nmsba board is doing and I think that it's we have to think of what the unintended

[01:36:00]
sequences are going to be by turning the role of the word president into a group project what I continually hear is that communication isn't there like board member to morito I hear you say that you just you don't feel like you're getting communicated with I hear you say that and I also know that we have been operating since January under a Distributive leadership role I mean in theory the board president could be doing all of the facilitation she could be doing all of the time tracking she could be doing everything but she has distributed all of that when she makes committee assignments it's distributed when we track our time Secretary of score

[01:37:00]
distributes that the facilitation guide It's distributed we've all done the work she's implemented at a glance where every week she tells us exactly what she's been doing and what Dr Blakey has been doing we have members are given a chance to insert I've inserted things I've done that I mean we have opportunities to communicate but we also and I'm really looking forward to December we are supposed to have a policy that lines all of these communication issues out that you that everybody that the board is a hole not just a couple board members you know when you say like I've heard from a couple people okay you heard from a couple people about something but the whole board has said we need communication and there should be a

[01:38:00]
beyond that and so I'm really looking forward to December when that RFI policy shows up because I'm really hoping that it addresses these issues that we've been talking about for the last 2 months so I'll I'll conclude and then I'm just I will see it for the record I don't agree with any of these changes I think they are creating major inefficiencies within an effective governance structure thank you I just want to reiterate however that there is a difference between Dr Blakey needing to be the chief person and in charge of I mean she's hired by us but however we are all elected officials

[01:39:00]
and so that plays into it is that fact and a strong feeling that I think was articulated in September when we all brought up the need to have a retreat that we were not feeling well represented or that our needs are not being met and so I really appreciate the the recommendation to perhaps put let's see the president will instead of striking and I hope our policy analyst is listening rather than striking H and no no no no

[01:40:00]
i n j from underneath the the role of the president we simply add with an open invitation to executive committee members to attend at all anytime possible okay and again I think it's important that for the sake of transparency and a benefits both the board and the superintendent to have those open conversations and then will will it just occurred to me board member we might want to include something or have something prepared under the RFI committee work to address how that gets reported

[01:41:00]
route to to the board more than likely under the president's report but I do hear that most of us on the committee are open to a more transparent and broader participatory model for some of these items that are listed here and I do want to draw our attention to under the board president will there is Al and correct me if I'm wrong policy analyst Martinez where we going to make Alice separate number or work or are we going to begin with

[01:42:00]
on behalf of the board with prior specific Authority from a majority of the board Madam chair wasn't part of any changes to that to remove it from the section I mean that's certainly something that could be proposed tonight but for right now I have it included under the list yes yes yes so the only thing so this is just a we discussed it I remember talking with Johanna King chief of staff that removing the president will only and then act you begin L with act and then only four or on behalf of the board with prior specific Authority and we tried to get that in before tonight so we wouldn't have this conversation so but it escaped that edit

[01:43:00]
and so I think that's an important I'm going to reiterate that the board president acts only for or on behalf of the board with prior specific Authority from a majority of the board and and that is very intentionally there because unlike superintendent Blakey who can pretty much call the shots and does the word president cannot can you repeat what you just said yes so it's under it's the very last item under the board president will it's all well it says l h and so Were Striking the president will and it will

[01:44:00]
start with Act only for or on behalf of the board and this is called parallel construction because if you notice all the others they begin with a verb the president will provide coordinate sign approve Etc and so this has to start with act got it thank you you're welcome let's see the attend weekly meetings and E Back Down Under the president will but we will add language that makes sense

[01:45:00]
open and I can repeat the language if you need that Miss Martinez okay you got it okay any anything else and and I'm going to say that cautiously because I think it's time to to bring the meeting to a close we did have a chance to look at all these and weigh in I'd like to move on to our final the final agenda item number report

[01:46:00]
board members to serve on external board committees just because again that is a president's role to be able to point those Ward members I don't see the executive committee needing to do that and that's not something that we've discussed as an executive committee wanting to do so I just wanted to put last one out there as well board member do you want to weigh in before I say something you always in I think that that's that's appropriate I think it kind of goes to what we talked about in the policy meeting last time so it's that is the that is the president's role I will also point out that there is an inaccuracy that the board president does not actually attend weekly meetings with the Council of great City Schools they are per monthly

[01:47:00]
and procedures actually say that it's the board president or a designee so again you know these changes are being brought forth but there isn't any Frost consideration of procedures that are already in place so you know I I get it I understand the intent behind it but I think that when you're when you're bringing forth changes it's really important to be accurate I also have a question of why there was an addition of and coordinate the preparation of monthly agendas it seems like a redundant sentence when you're already saying that they will participate in agenda preparation we thought we already have that like the executive committee already participates in agenda will participate in agenda preparation so why is there an addition of

[01:48:00]
parenthetical phrases are saying the same thing could you refer the number and the 1818 the executive committee will include the president vice president and secretary and will participate in and coordinate the preparation of monthly agenda monthly agendas for all regular board meetings that sentence before the addition of and coordinate the preparation of monthly it's why why is that sentence was already saying that exact same thing so that was taken straight from the manual except just merged into one one sentence instead of two and I'm looking for it

[01:49:00]
and it's under I believe it's under the president of the executive committee

[01:50:00]
we will meet as needed to coordinate reports to the board and confer about upcoming issues that can be read two ways right like you there's already monthly established monthly meetings that the executive committee knows that they need to show up to and trust me like when I'm saying this I'm using executive committee in the in the broadest sense I am not I realize I have to many people sitting right here I'm trying to think like what's next you're going to look like there's already monthly meetings so is the addition of as needed is that meant to create more meetings is that meant to create less meetings yeah potentially both it just provides some flexibility but do you see how that could be like how is that efficient if

[01:51:00]
like if you already know that you have a monthly meeting that that's where you're going to have your agendas and that's where you're going to talk about things again like to to this point that we keep bringing up that there are people who work it's it's it's it's it's hard I mean it's easier to have established times instead of well it's just when we need it and hopefully two of us can get together I'm just really so I hear what you're saying and I so I would propose is that I mean we we got this document ahead of time and I understand I understand how our time is limited and perhaps we didn't get questions in and suggested edits okay so this did not appear but the questions that you're raising now but they're important and I think they're important

[01:52:00]
get dressed and so I guess I'm there's nothing saying that we can't revisit am I correct Ms Martinez because what I'm trying to do here is wrap this up here to bring us the board the board can revisit okay I mean the committee the community can revisit I'm interested in getting this right and so I'm happy to I encourage you to to send in your your your edits justifications and we will work together right and if it requires a third week you know I think what's

[01:53:00]
most important for me is that we get it right ultimately that's the goal I don't want to make this thing just to reiterate the executive committee does meet as needed and we've had other meetings to where she would call upon us to meet and so it is it is it is as needed piece so just so that it's just not on the month to whatever the situation is or if needed to do make a decision thank you so with that again I invite comments and observations and suggested edits and so I'd like to move on to the chair report and wrap this meeting up okay based on the discussion at tonight's

[01:54:00]
the board policies recommended for archive by the ad hoc committee made up of members Jackson and Benavides will be added to the December 4th consent agenda to be archived by the board staff will add policies that the policy Review Committee has agreed to keep or keep or modify to the diligent site along with the board's existing policies policies recommended for modification will undergo further review what we are proposing is that to the board and to the president is that she reconvene the ad-hoc policy Review Committee to continue the work on the modified the six that need modification and so that would mean that

[01:55:00]
do you remember recommending that members Jackson and Benavides continue that work yes and they will complete their work and come back to the policy committee with their recommendations the RFI ad hoc committee chaired by vice presidential completed its research regarding board request for information on October 2nd the proposed draft of this new policy will be presented for first read at the December 2nd policy meeting following the policy committee discussion and recommendations for 30 days and reviewed for a second read at the January 6th policy meeting following the government's manual regarding board officers roles and responsibilities the proposed revisions to the policy will be posted for public comment

[01:56:00]
timer 30 days and schedule for a second read at an upcoming meeting following the committee's recommendations regarding the roles of board committees and committee chairs during tonight's second reading of sections for I for J and 4K of the governance manual the policy will be presented to the board for approval and adoption on consent at the November 20th board meeting our next policy committee meeting will be Monday December 2nd at 5:00 p.m. virtually watch on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel and with that we are adjourned thank you
