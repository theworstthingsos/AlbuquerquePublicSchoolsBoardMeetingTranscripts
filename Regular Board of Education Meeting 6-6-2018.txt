I've been asked to see if our ATF Union president would like to say just a few words Ellen I want you to know when we piloted this program it was a big reach to start in 0506 with 100 new teachers by the time Linda was ready to retire we were mentoring over 400 new teachers every single year we asked Linda period

[00:04:00]

[00:11:00]
I appreciate you doing that as a former United States Marine myself my son headed straight into ROTC after graduating he will be a future Marine officer and just like Mr zimbeck he will lead men and women in combat I'm opposed to your proposal to take funding away from the Junior ROTC program I encourage you to approach it like you would any other problem that this District faces and look at it through an objective lenses we're not going to come together as a country if we engage in the demonization of organizations in the dehumanization of members of such organizations I'm a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association I'm actually proud to say that here it's an organization that focuses AG

[00:12:00]
play on safety for children and the funding for these programs or what's going to help train and educate young men and women who God forbid may be included on the list of people for whom you held a moment of silence tonight we need the funding to be pursued in an objective way and when you do make this decision I want you to in your own mind ask yourself what if we if we take this funding away because it came from this organization what are we going to do objectively and I would propose that the answer is nothing other than perhaps feeling like you have some kind of moral High Ground thank you good evening my name is Anthony Segura and I came to just tell a story similar to the gentleman before

[00:13:00]
play my twin brother actually went to ROTC at Highland he graduated from high school and immediately went into the Navy he retired after 20 years as myself I retired as a veteran myself as a Air Force Major I have two nieces that graduated from from La Cueva High School both went into the military they were both in ROTC please don't consider anything that may cut ROTC programs in Albuquerque high schools that I mentioned actually went to the Air Force Academy graduated she graduates next week from the airport College in Alabama as a colonel in the United States Air Force that is she is a prodigy of APs so please look at that

[00:14:00]
we need every funding and the NRA being an NRA member life member myself the NRA I wish people would stop vilifying this organization we are here to do anything but allow people that shouldn't have firearms to have firearms I'm a concealed carry instructor I've been an NRA instructor teaching thousands of students from children to adults how to safely use a firearm and that's my goal I'm a New Mexico concealed carry instructor here in New Mexico program there's also a program called the school safety Shield program I'm trying to get this out to everybody in New Mexico this program is talks how we can get funding to support the safety in schools I've got information for you please accept one of these from me thank you

[00:15:00]
good evening lights in German my name is John Jackson forgive me if I'm a little bit tongue-tied but I really don't speak well in public I'm here today about the JROTC proposal to reject funding from the NRA to my knowledge all of these funds come from New Mexicans in New Mexico it is not from the NRA itself I just hope that you do not stop receiving funds we have nothing like this in Australia where I am from and we should it helps young children or young men and women in military or in civilian life I really wish I had something like this back home

[00:16:00]
but I really hope you do not stop taking these phones it is not a lot of money I know but every cent helps coming from New Mexicans for New Mexico for New Mexico children thank you very much for allowing me to speak our next three speakers Zachary forts Mark Abrams Abramson and Diana Garris president of the Mexico Shooting Sports Association where the state New Mexico but I'm here to speak tonight about the NRA funding for the JROTC program a little bit more specifics where the money comes from and how its allocated so the money actually comes from an organization known as the foundation which is a part of

[00:17:00]
the friends of the NRA the friends of the NRA is a 501 c 3 organization that means that they are explicitly prohibited from engaging in political speech or making donations to political candidates while Friends of the NRA is a part of the larger NRA umbrella they are distinctly separate from the political arm of the Yankees so where does where does the money that frenzy an array comes from what actually comes from right here in New Mexico they hold fundraisers across the state of New Mexico including here in Albuquerque to raise money to give to the aps JROTC programs so that money comes from people quite frankly like like me I've donated to NRA Foundation before so it can be used for the purposes of building tomorrow's leaders and teaching firearm safety and on the subject of firearm safety there's a foundation firearm safety programs in any other organization in the country so I please employ you to not reject this funding it comes from right here

[00:18:00]
play New Mexico that has been allocated for New Mexico children to learn to learn leadership skills to learn many other skills of the JROTC program teaches them so please implore you not to reject this funding thank you thank you mister president board members my name is Mark abrahamson I live in the North Valley and own Los Ranchos gun shops last week I was training 43 people to learn how to teach others to shoot safely weather pistol to help bolster the Boy Scout program at the Philmont Scout Ranch fundamentally the NRA since 1871 has been committed to the training and Educational Foundation does

[00:19:00]
50% of the money raised in New Mexico stays in New Mexico and is committed to our youth weather 4-H Boy Scouts in our local councils and the JROTC program the other half goes to National programs which include the Boy Scouts of America so all of the costs of providing that program program materials comes from NRA grants from the foundation that separate entity the 501 c 3 organization that provides that funding it's very important that that funding be allowed to continue There is no prostitution there's no solicitation of membership there's no expectation that anyone receiving the money helps raise that money through gifting or in fact joins the NRA they are totally distinct the more important question I believe for the board is the resolution the larger resolution dealing

[00:20:00]
I'm with school safety and I would commend the board for undertaking to develop an Albuquerque solution to an Albuquerque problem while there is certainly a great effort to look to Congress for funding those of us who understand the legislative process no Congress is worthless so we need to look internally thank you thank you continue down at El Dorado and she got a lot of benefits out of it I got to know a lot of the kids they got they all benefited from this program is just ridiculous I mean

[00:21:00]
nobody from the NRA ever talks to kids or anything so I think that cutting it would be a big mistake for you guys to do thank you next speakers are David Williams James Wilkinson and looks like Joseph I can't read your last name Josephine

[00:22:00]
school safety it is indeed tragic when our children are afraid to go to school but especially tragic when it's largely so in necessary because these fears are greatly overblown since 2000 the Box approximately 17 facial school shootings have occurred on campuses school and college 17 too many to be sure and I agree that school security should be improved but compare that with the number of 3 5

[00:23:00]
control measures offered such as Banning so-called assault rifles which are responsible for only about 3% of all guns shootings and would be impossible to sneak into a school past even rudimentary school security measures I agree that school security measures should be taken mental health issues should be addressed but we should not be waiting for the federal government to shower money upon us these issues we can take issues on these things locally thank you thank you for about 25 years in a position in life shall we say

[00:24:00]
no children in school no grandchildren never mind but I'm looking forward to his what's going to happen to the kids in our city here or state and Country because such things as the ROTC programs particularly in the high schools were these students are most likely to be selected to go to some of our military academies and that's worth about 40,000 or 50,000 a year per student and what happens when APS assume we've done our students in the city here opportunity to get these scholarships the State football

[00:25:00]
Alan Wagman and Janet Sears counselors thank you for this opportunity to speak the previous comments about the NRA I am a proud member of the NRA when I have had the opportunity to be part of an awards presentation to ROTC Cadets and some of the schools you would be so proud of these Cadets articulate respectful they've taken responsibility they are some of the finest young people I have ever

[00:26:00]
sing our interacted with to take away if that's your proposal to take away money NRA money and deny opportunities for these junior junior ROTC students would be a tragic mistake so I feel that I needed to come and speak on that one issue in your resolution I disagree with talks about expanding the gun free zones I believe that what attracts some of these shooters to schools is they're not afraid to come and shoot people up in high schools and that's wrong so I'm not sure I would agree with expanding gun free zones and thank you thank you

[00:27:00]
Mr President members of the board my name is Alan Wagner and a resident of Albuquerque our children are being trained in JROTC to use guns and this board is allowing the NRA to provide the guns when the Santa Fe school board was looking for funding to replace there and are a grant for JROTC the NRA said quote the school board should be made to absorb the cost of this program out of their own budget what that means is the NRA values its opportunity to influence our children more than it values the schools having money for math or science classes don't let somebody else provide the money take it out of the education budget what is the NRA

[00:28:00]
using its influence for Josh Sugarman of the violence policy Center said quote what drives the NRA and the gun industry today is the fact that household gun ownership is in steady decline to borrow a phrase from the tobacco industry the NRA and the gun manufacturing industry are trying to find replacement Shooters to take their place on quote JROTC is set to teach discipline leadership and good citizenship even if so why are guns necessary the Mercury Stoneman Douglas shooter was an avid JROTC participant who was fascinated with guns do we really need to risk that here take the guns out of JROTC and if you want to do that at least take the NRA out thank you

[00:29:00]
good evening Mr President members of the board Madame superintendent another staff and I'm Janet Sayers with the Del Norte High School alumni association and actually on my way here I was listening to KOB radio and people were calling in with their memories about D-Day so I guess I just wanted to start by saying June 6th of 1944 with certainly a turning point in American history and but then also I think today was the 50th anniversary of the death of Bobby Kennedy which was my whole generation of the late 60s and but actually I didn't know all these other people were going to be speaking about the the Junior ROTC program but all I know about it I did not read all the information in the packet on the internet but at Del Norte High School

[00:30:00]
Junior ROTC is an important program a lot of kids are involved in that they're learning leadership skills they're learning discipline their learning the importance of teamwork of a practice and so I'm not really sure what all is being discussed but but to me it's a very valuable program for the the students at Del Norte and when I come to the meetings I always learn something and I make some connections and I have the Good Fortune of sitting behind Linda Bluestein who I Learned was a 1971 graduate of deli and now that she's retired and so I got her phone number and I know anyway but again thank you for your service thank you for the time you spend away from your family and

[00:31:00]
the energy that you put into a serving on the board of education thank you write our final two speakers Sydney Garris and Amaya I wish I could say your last name OK Google

[00:32:00]
police departments New Mexico Military Institute everybody that needed stuff we provide a money for equipment for practice targets pallets and stuff that otherwise these programs would have to go out and try to find money or fundraise to get a lot of these kids have also were able to participate at the national level because of friends are a money they went to the Olympic Training Center participated in competitions in Ohio Alabama and other states as well these kids got the opportunity to travel for otherwise they wouldn't have been able to do so at no cost to themselves this money help them to compete and we all have a few people from Albuquerque schools that made national champion from El Dorado

[00:33:00]
you know that portion of where these kids were able to go and what they were able to do and what they were able to accomplish and you should be proud of them I know they didn't get much recognition here in the state and from the media and stuff but they did to Albuquerque proud and I think you guys should understand that recognize that and I think you all for your time and I appreciate all that you guys are doing for our kids thank you thank you thank you the campaign that established to stop the school shootings which happened so frequently there have been over 30 this year alone I would like to ask him to reject the NRA is a program that trains students to handle weapons as well as normalizing the side of weapons

[00:34:00]
by accepting this money which Mr Percy told other members of our group would not actually significantly impact the funding of Roxy being a rather small donation is it would not significantly impact this program which I've been told by many people people that I respect is in fact a wonderful program but rejecting the money that is coming from an organization or sister organization that does not condemn refuses to condemn the School shooters which Slaughter of my schoolmates and pierce your stating that you value the money that they give you this relatively small donation over our school safety for everyone else about the car comment we do train people how to use cars and they are more heavily regulated that's just my note so thank you

[00:35:00]
I hope you consider a regulation we hope that you postpone this vote because most of our members are out of town on family vacations they could not avoid them as they're underage please postpone this till the next meeting when we can all be here and we hope to work with you to come to a resolution that includes youth voices and youth action and youth opinion rather than that only of adults we hope to be involved in this problem thank you thank you thank you for that tonight

[00:36:00]
best maintenance and operation teams often work with APS vendors on front landscape projects that are schools recently they worked at Taft and Hoover Middle Schools you can see from the workers so is it on maybe it's oh there it is you can see from the workers on the screens that they were very very busy and thanks to the efforts of a parent Jocelyn Strauss the landscaping plants and materials for the Taft projected at Taft Avenue provided the Manpower that would be 16 years and they donated over 265 hours of Labor they were planting digging installing irrigations and I hear tell that they

[00:37:00]
we're singing I've been working on the railroad all day long so I think I put that little song in your head it's not going to go away our own John dufay delivered lots of pizzas and Pepsis for lunch for some very hungry hot workers more than $4,000 in donations of building and landscape materials came from local businesses around the school itself the fact is and the Landscaping at Taft was completed in one day and this was a major project and so we're very very proud and I think the kids were just thrilled when they showed up the school that that Monday and saw magic at Hoover 855 volunteers from Southwest Airlines a dozen PTA members a dozen or so parents and

[00:38:00]
there's a 1000 on their landscape project Southwest Airlines dedicated their work to the spirit and contributions of Jennifer Riordan both projects were filled with hard work and Community spirit and when the community and APS team up great things truly truly happen so APS from across the district students APS students from across the district were recognized this year thanks to Lucinda Credit Union and the 8 p.m. Education Foundation schools are selected at random and they're asked to choose a student of the week the task force on the principal who often seek staff nominations the aps student of the week is featured in the Albuquerque Journal on Mondays as well as at 8:00 p.m. and our social media

[00:39:00]
what venues let's watch a short video of some of the amazing APS students

[00:40:00]
go

[00:41:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:42:00]
celebrate celebrating our students a lot of good things are happening in APS one of the things that we need to celebrate is the fact that Monday we turned in our APS school budget was 1.35 billion dollar budget what was the entire full budget and it went up to Santa Fe and the Beautiful part also is that includes aside from new projects and programs and ideas at all so includes money for razors for all employees for the first time in years the operational portion of the budget which is where these raises are is nearly $694 million dollars and most of it comes from the state through a formula known as the student Equalization guarantee or the year increase by 2% for 1899

[00:43:00]
the increase is expected to cover raises of at least 2.5% for teachers counselor School nurses and Librarians and all other APS employees are expected to get at least a 2% raise in addition the minimum salary for teachers is expected to increase by $2,000 per level to 36,000 for new or level one teacher 44 for level two teachers and 54,000 for level 3 teachers salaries are increases are subject to Union negotiations and we're just about completing that and but it could all of this could be effective by July 1st which is the beginning of the 1819 school year for Christmas for the first time in nearly a decade the district hasn't had to face multimillion dollar budget

[00:44:00]
Cuts last year APS make Cuts totally more than 25 million but things are really looking very very positive for everyone for 1819 school year and I just think that it's time to celebrate that and I want to thank Tammy Coleman and the AFT and our Union Representatives as well for a different negotiating teams that we have together because they just have worked tirelessly and I'm just very very happy with the outcome of the hard work that took place the spring so thank you guys really appreciate it and that concludes the superintendent report thank you thank you we'll go on to the station is the consideration approval of the charter school contract performance for technology high school discussion

[00:45:00]
action and Sanders are Miss Elder executive director of innovation school choice and Dr Joseph Escobedo director of The Office of well know you're not the director of charter schools Mr President members of the board superintendent Mrs Elder is in class or so she sends her apologies she's virtually tapping into her doctoral program so she's not able to be here tonight tonight we are asking for your approval of two Charter School contracts and their corresponding performance Frameworks as you will be reminded these two charter schools in the renewal process after we reviewed them and recommended approval to you technology leadership high school did have conditions that needed to be met prior to the contract and performance

[00:46:00]
Mark being executed so they have met those conditions and we have negotiated their mission-specific goals the executive director of the school Kara cortazar has the stomach flu or she would be here today in fact she sends her regrets what we do have their legal counsel in case we have any questions and there are two Mission specific goals one is around working on increasing developmental assets of students and the second is having students demonstrate Mastery of their designated learning outcomes which is focused on technology work in fact I was at the school last week or two weeks ago helping with their portfolio reviews for the first one any comments from the board members

[00:47:00]
are they scared when they see you coming OK Google and I cried for an hour and a half so a little like unbalanced so I apologize I'm curious because the steps with the leadership High School

[00:48:00]
that make some more Dynamic relationship between APS and the and the technology leadership High School Mr President and Miss Peterson were starting that work actually with Ace leadership high school and so really understanding how they want about business Partnerships and working with the trades and so we have not done that with the other schools and so that's the work that Mrs Elder and I are beginning to to work and so we have not set up anything formally besides just the language but we will bring you an update on how that's progressing can you say just a little bit about what the developmental assets profile looks like the developmental asset profile is something that the leadership Network schools have been using for a while and so it's an inventory of really understanding how the students are emotionally responding to different situations

[00:49:00]
and how they're growing over the year to either their knowledge and also their use of those developmental assets but I'll get you the developmental asset profile so you can take a deeper understanding of that and I would say that they are one of the network of schools who is doing this work and social emotional work out of all of our Charter Schools well thank you Google can you just tell me a little bit more about the the assessments the interim assessments and the common state assessments what was the participation percentage for both of those both actually had over 95% participation thresholds and so

[00:50:00]
there was some concerns in the initial review of some of the data that they provided that they didn't have enough participation after really understanding what they were providing and having that clarification from them we understood that they were at that 95% or higher and so they had met that that state threshold and so we wanted to ensure that they were at the at that measure and that they were continuing to meet that okay thank you have a second thank you he is the executive director of Cottonwood classical

[00:51:00]
Victoria school and so this school was recommended and approved in the fall for a 5-year renewal they are moving from the public education commission to be authorized by the Albuquerque Public School Board of Education their mission specific goals won the first one is around participation successful completion and participation in the international Baccalaureate program and last year they met the school and the second is around really measuring the students being accepted to an accredited college or university and so those are two goals and those are specifically around their mission of international Baccalaureate and college preparatory school so we stand for questions

[00:52:00]
any questions from the board my only question is I know that it says that they will be accepted to an accredited college or university so this doesn't include colleges obviously that accept everyone cuz I know that was a concern from from ped that that was being used as an alternative demonstration of Competency but they were giving those acceptance letters but they were universities or colleges that accepted everyone so I just want to know if this was a case I don't know of a snake pictures of the acceptance letters for our students if they are accepted doing accredited college University that counts in our data with regard to that

[00:53:00]
okay thank you so what there what in the alternative I'm just asking because I know this is going to be a rule change that ped has is going to put in effect and so right now for alternative demonstrations of Competency so let's say a child doesn't pass the park exam and doesn't pass there's lots of ways to get your diploma so one of the ways that some school districts were using were acceptance letters from colleges and universities as one of the alternative demonstrations of Competency to get their diploma so now what it was is it a lot of these school districts were using acceptance letters from colleges accepted everyone there is a proposal

[00:54:00]
governments that specifically address is board member Mueller out of going has and will be bringing you a briefing and a recommended response to that at the district equity and engagement committee I think they're going to have a time I think doctor where people are going to be able to speak about it though I believe I remember the secretary saying that to me so Mr President members of the board the rule was released on Friday to superintendents and Charter School leaders unfortunately has not been posted to the public education department website so I monitor it everyday wearing my government Affairs at and so once it comes out we'll get official response ready but this will be part of the government Affairs update at the district equity and engagement committee all the proposed rule changes I believe there are four new ones that have come out since our last meeting any other changes any of the comments I'll entertain a motion for approval

[00:55:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:56:00]
on March 7th put out a resolution herself that kind of supported the resolution of the council great City schools have but we also added on that a paragraph at the end of that and that paragraph said now be it for the result of the Albuquerque Public Schools district will develop its own resolution that will involve community members as to how to improve Local School Safety and Security and so we've been doing a lot of that and I've been thinking like I have mentioned to you exactly how we would present that and how we would revisit that as a board and and so the main thing tonight is to take a look at what we have been doing in that regard and I have asked our chief operating officer Scott Helder to provide some kind of summary background of what we've really been doing not only marks

[00:57:00]
but what we've been doing in general to try to look at our school safety issues and really take positive actions in terms of what we're really doing to actually help improve our our our our safety and and and and and security of our schools and so that's one part of this and that's part of a a resolution that I've put together on the basis of of a little bit of that as well as some other issues that have come up I did also meet with a a group of of community members and students this past Wednesday who are here at city center and wanted to talk about the NRA TC program and they were pretty expensive about the fact that they did not want an area in the Junior

[00:58:00]
time for considerable length of time and one of the things that I asked of them is is what exactly would not accepting the money due to really help us in our school safety I wanted to know how that was really going to to help us in that in that Arena and one of the things I asked for that group was to consider what they would ask NRA to do in other words if they want to have something improved and they believe that the NRA is not helping with that Improvement in some way or whatever the question is what would we have NRA do to help us with our school safety in other words right and I wanted them to tell me that I wanted them to give me some suggestions about give me some bullets or something you know tell me what would NRA do to

[00:59:00]
in the business of helping us prevent some of the school issues and the gun violence and whatever that we have in our schools right now and so the agreement I had with him was that they would give me a draft of that information so that I could work out a resolution that I could actually support if we could support that I have not really heard from them and I can't really necessarily follow them for not giving me that information but that's kind of where I'm going with regard to this idea of the NRA what it means so what I did is I put together a resolution that involved actually quite a few words from board member who had provided some some words when we were doing the great City Schools resolution and also put in some words about the NRA

[01:00:00]
terms of the idea of saying what we would like in a way to do is take some real leadership in this role of how do we really work with some of the root causes that we believe are some of the issues that go with with some of the gun violence that we see they're already doing quite a few things that I think do in fact reflect safety guns and so forth but the question is is what kind of leadership would you like to have in order for us to say yes we can accept one of the other things that I wanted to make clear in the resolution that I put together and that the board will I have given the board for kind of review and I want the other pieces I want to make clear is that this is not a comment on the jrtc programming and I support all the funding that's Junior

[01:01:00]
certainly not a whole lot from the NRA so whatever the board decides what are we decide we're going to still fund the jury to see program it's not going to be cut there's not going to be any reduction in the funds will find those funds where we have to in general those funds are probably less than $15,000 a year that's not very much money we've had it what 7/8 years and we've got about 120,000 over those eight years and that go to several different high schools and other several different high schools have maybe 3,000 to 2000 dollars those kinds of grant that they get and they use those monies for basically equipment in other words for uniforms for buying so that's kind of with the money so it isn't a lot of money I think it's more a perception of

[01:02:00]
accepting money from an organization that's it's probably under attack for for their support of guns for their support of the use of guns now however one wants to put that together the NRA has many different branches so to speak of their organization they have a political Branch they have like you say the NRA Foundation which is if I want to see three and that's where it is funds actually comes through is that foundation and it is actually like some of the speakers mentioned those funds do actually come from New Mexico so I want to make sure that that I have looked through that to see exactly what that information is and so I think I've heard so the resolution itself is is is is conifer and that's why I didn't really want to share it terribly with anybody until the board members really had a chance to look at it and had a chance to make their own comments and

[01:03:00]
and what they want to do with this I know that there's been some speakers that talked about the group that was here that was not able to be here I did not hear that when I talked with them just a week ago I would have been nice if they would have said you know we're going to be on vacation and you know that's not going to be able to be here for the for the 6th so could we put it on a different time it was my understanding they would be here tonight so I did not hear that except tonight so it's up to the board here as to how you want to go about the resolution itself I could certainly read the resolution in total so that the people I don't want you guys out here to be unfamiliar with what's in the resolution and we can talk about it or we could go through and see if you want kind of changes what kind of things you think ought to be in it or we can just continue because there's a lot more in terms of

[01:04:00]
what are the community involvement in that but the first thing I really wanted to do was to let Scott actually give us a summary of what we've actually been doing cuz I think a lot of times people don't know how much we have actually been doing in terms of looking at our school Safety and Security we've been doing a lot and so the things that we asked in that resolution was that we would actually continue to work with community members which we have done we work with a lot of organizations out there Statewide in fact in terms of what should we be doing in terms of helping to improve our security so there are a lot of areas here that I think Scott can talk to so I'm going to let Scott have a few moments here to give us some kind of a background of what we have been doing and that I think it'll help the discussion in terms of certainly the audience knowing that we are in fact Proactiv here in terms of what we're doing to develop improve school safety security

[01:05:00]
I want I want to appreciate the comment that we're really not talking about the elimination of JROTC programs I'm getting a lot of emails calls and that goes back to a comment that was made in the paper by a young person who simply said something to report her and it was reported that doesn't mean that that's what we're doing so I want to be very clear we are not talking about eliminating a program that serves a lot of students I do want to share some information on the NRA grants themselves that you guys have as much information on exactly how they work and exactly what we've received and what they've been spent on we've spent a lot of work and time researching this and and I think we've got a pretty complete picture normally I'd be joined by Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Ingalls who replace our Junior ROTC Commander unfortunately he is actually in Florida with a group of people

[01:06:00]
participating in a conversation around this topic on Fusion television so in his place I have major Jim korber major corporate is the El Dorado Commander he ran the program for the first half of the Year while we were in between commanders he's well versed in the programs and if you have questions about JROTC or how these funds are expended he's here to answer those questions for you this all sort of began a few months ago when we received a question from a reporter from outside of New Mexico about the fact that APS had received 125,000 in Grants from the NRA Foundation sense 2010 the reporter had no information on who received the grants or how they were spent they just wanted to know what what we were doing taking all this money the numbers been reported more than once so therefore it must be true however as you learned tonight the grant don't really come from the

[01:07:00]
when are they come from the sister organization the friends of the NRA I think you learned enough about that tonight I don't feel I could add anything to what the people have explained these grants and other thing that needs to be clarified is his grants really don't come to APS I've had a number of very clear letters expressing opinions to me about my accepting these grants and what they would like me to do with them and and that's you know fine but the grants mostly go to the individual schools and it can be any organization that can apply for them it is not always jail to see all those in Albuquerque it has been that 4-H clubs often will apply for these funds as well and so in the region around us that money is spent in that way because the money flows to the schools and the individual groups the monies tracked through the school activity counts

[01:08:00]
that made it a little more difficult for us because we had to go out to each individual school look back through years of don't know deposits and expenses to make sure you know exactly what came in so we have data going back to 2012 and we learned the following of our 13 schools a seven of the schools have submitted Grant requests the the annual request well I've seen you see Grant request for as low as $250 you'll see a grant request as high as $8,000 each year the average has been somewhere between 16 to 19,000 with one major exception in 2015 we had three schools apply for significant funds for the ranges the high tech targets and they put up backboards

[01:09:00]
Robert loves to talk about the Creedmoor system he's very excited I can hear him back there Breathing heavily already but they're very expensive and so that you took 43,000 over the past two years last year we took 1500 and so far this year Well actually through 2017 we took 6,000 so it really varies depending on unit need the things that are purchased tend to be for the most part the Precision air rifles for the shooting competitions if you are a school that wants to compete in these Precision events then you have to have a quality air rifle they're not guns they are rifles you want to take care of it you buy a nice case you buy the equipment that goes with it the schools I could say it's the schools that have a hard time raising money to buy these so they can be

[01:10:00]
competitive with the schools that don't have a hard time raising money but it seems to be a mix it really does the grants are there to support the students and what the what I was explaining to me by the the grand Tours was they look to support programs that are trying to build programs are not really granting money to the highly successful programs they're trying to help those programs or the kids are trying to learn where the kids need the extra training with the kids need the extra access to equipment so the total funds that actually went to schools from 2012 to the president's about 106,000 and again there was one 7600 and the school that received the most 24,000 so just a thought on what they they use them for some of the units are not pursuing the grants they have the reasons for not doing it it's it's a case by case basis

[01:11:00]
and the commander sometimes will tell you I don't need it I have the equipment I need sometimes I'll tell you I don't have the time to write the grant sometimes I just don't want to do it what it does it use this operational funding freeze them up to use the money for other events so for example we have a junior Leadership Camp going on currently next week I will be going to a sale camp where the cadets learn to sail across coach of the lake and I'm very hopeful that I will not be I'm really hopeful that invite me as ballast because I have a very bad feeling that I'm going to be on one of those boats I remember how big they are so Road one is a child and I'm significantly larger so but that's that's what those sort of things so that's the funding those are the dollar amounts it's not a huge sum except for the one year that was a big year

[01:12:00]
is there any schools that really drove 2015 that's the grants as far as school security and and so in terms of the bigger picture there's there's a number of areas that that we can talk about and I will tell you that on Monday copt agenda you're going to get a very comprehensive overview of what we're doing on the capital side so what I'm going to say tonight just in terms of of bacon to short as I can is a 30,000 ft overview okay so but there's basically four areas you want to look at when you're contemplating school security the first is education you mentioned that we went out and talk to the community we met with lots of student groups and the number one thing they reported back to us was that they never really understood the importance of lockdown drills that it was not explaining well to them that the staff never really you know forced him to do it the way probably they should have done it

[01:13:00]
can kids as a result really didn't take it terribly seriously they tended to happen at times that were very convenient the kids were all in class we know it was coming so everybody would you know close the door sneak up to the front and play on their cell phones or whatever and it was until the bell rang post Parkland responses we need to understand this we want more information we want to know what's supposed to happen and we want to know what's supposed to happen when it's not convenient when we're not all in class so what you see is a much much more focused in this coming year on lockdown drills lockdown drills that happen at funny times lockdown drills that are going to put people in in difficult positions to make difficult decisions and really working with those students and staff to make sure they understand what they are expected to do what we know is that there's no perfect solution to this and when something happens

[01:14:00]
do the best you can and that's the question we give to everybody what if what if what if I can go 1000 what if you do the best you can you make the best decision you can and you do the best you can to keep children and staff safe so that's the educational component to we must continue to improve our prevention efforts so we talk all the time about the importance of counselors and social workers another thing we do is we train our staffs on suicide prevention we train them on bloodborne pathogens we train them on the immigration law we change them on so many different systems recognizing warning signs clearly is another component of the prevention what I will say is we had last year in number of incidents that were quite frankly frightening and scared people in Albuquerque guns on campus at reported and that will respond to nobody likes to hear this but it everything

[01:15:00]
it was supposed to happen did somebody made a ridiculous and foolish decision to bring a gun onto campus a student sought reported it to an adult the adult actually did with the adult was supposed to do and took steps and everything was confiscated and nobody was hurt now whether that's child meant to hurt somebody or not is irrelevant you brought it to campus you showed it to somebody it got reported having been a principal who's dealt with that very situation numerous times and having been the one that's had to reach into the backpacks or reach into jackets and reach into lockers I appreciate the right thing happening it's scary when it happens it's unnerving and we do a better job of telling people about it there was a time we just said well nobody knows we'll just keep it quiet no people want to know now so we tell people but I want people to hear those prevention steps work when everybody works together and that's working with

[01:16:00]
students and the staff and the parent Community to make sure nothing happens and that's the one step of what we need to improve third one is communication we continue to work and look at how we communicate with the Albuquerque Police Department in the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office include the UNM police department and this as well because we had an incident with Monte Vista that we we were in communication with you and MPD and so we have to make sure that our systems are aligned that we can actually work together and then we're all speaking the same language so one of the areas it's being worked on this summer is we have a protocol for what happens in a lockdown nationally steps are changing County Sheriff's office has its own acronyms for how to handle it has its acronyms so we are sitting with both and we are going to have a process so no matter who responds to what school they understand what we're doing

[01:17:00]
inside and we're doing what they expect us to be doing and we're using language and terminology it's the same and we can be said that's an example of improved communication another example would be the real-time crime Center that APD has been very open about they would like to share information with them and to be a part of so that if something were to happen at school they would have the ability to work with us carefully and maybe see what's going on and have floor plans and we've worked out ways is that can happen in a very secure rescue manner there's some things that I could careful because I'm not allowed to say some things and I get excited so that's communication the last is in this is the one you have more about on Monday is the facilities and you hear it referred to often as hardening the facilities but that's the stone cold reality with now we have to change our facilities so that it is harder for

[01:18:00]
things to happen and we don't we don't just deal with the active shooter situation that's the very rare incredibly high risk situation we deal with a lot of very common somewhat low risk that robbery fights drugs so we have to build security systems that address both so sometimes people get upset when I say we're improving our security cameras what does that help with the shooter it does it helps us tell stuff afterwards and it helps if we need to know where he is but it's not going to stop the shooter that's right but on everything else it's very helpful so but we are really looking at some comprehensive ways to manage this so it was very tempting after Parkland to jump out and buy something we had money I want to go I want to buy something I want to go out and buy everybody want me to buy

[01:19:00]
electric door magnets and we can put them on every classroom door in the electric magnets would work great if you had a metal door frame wasn't so hot on the wooden frames we discovered there were some pictures of there was supposed to be a kid in Idaho that solved the problem with the door slide and you can stick the door slide in and open and door couldn't be open in it works great if the door swings in doesn't work the door swings out so it's tempting as some of these things were we said we got to stop and we had plenty of vendors coming in that were more than happy to visit with us and tell me how I can spend the money we have engaged in a assessment of all 140 of our sites and the charter schools that are in our facilities are part of the assessment as well period on ways to improve security from that we look at what we can do and prioritize steps for that part

[01:20:00]
recite we're working through about 12 to 14 sites a week that initial review is done by a technical committee that involves members of law enforcement it the maintenance and operations are capital Master planners in our facilities design and construction because what we know is our newer buildings are going to look a lot different but you have to design them differently we have to narrow access points we have to reduce the number of hidden Corners schools are just going to look different but we have a lot old schools that we have to work on to Albuquerque we have facilities with 15 buildings and each building has 18 doors very difficult so how do you reduce the number of doors people can get into so we're working on that through the electronic card readers and just locking doors and I can't tell you the one sometimes you want to find a solution I was told this this week you want to find

[01:21:00]
5 nickel solution cuz it'll be a quarter solution so last week you all signed off on about 400,000 for classroom door locks a lot of not very sexy not very exciting you know to talk about classroom door locks but what's going to happen and all 6900 our classroom doors will now be able to lock from the inside because we have rooms that don't lock from the inside so the assessment slowed us down and it got us to make some sensible steps that are going to allow us to move forward in ways that are very beneficial funding exists we know that and again you'll probably hear more about on Monday so we're working much more carefully with local law enforcement we are also integrating some local resources that Albuquerque has are experts that are volunteering some time with us we have an exceptionally good but we call security assessment and implementation

[01:22:00]
play the technical group that does the technical work and then they bring it to people like me and explain it to me so I can come and explain it to you but we make sure that we have the right people in the right place and so far what will be the feedback we're getting from the national experts is well done so some of the changes you'll see are not very visible that may be good some will be more visible as we start because we are we're going to have to fence buildings differently and we have to lock doors differently I walked into a school the other day walked right in the back door it was open and I said you probably shouldn't have that open this what's convenient for parents and I said yeah it was convenient for me too but you probably shouldn't leave it open you're just going to have to tell him to come around the front and I think parents will be willing to complain but they'll get used to it so that's the wild overview thank you Scott I appreciate that greatly

[01:23:00]
I think we're going to have a little bit more in our Capital meeting about some of those things right and so that's part of the you know the idea too is to kind of keep this this working I do have the resolution that I had put together and I and other than the fact that I did put it together at this point I have no particular ownership here in other words I just gave this as a kind of response and I want the board members to understand that so this is really up to the board as to how you want to deal with this so that people understand what it is that was put out and if we want I think it's good opportunity for us to discuss a little bit about what we really wanted to do here and if we want to change it accept it postponed it or deny it or something so I think what I'd like to do is just at least read it and that way we have everybody in the audience understands what

[01:24:00]
was put down and then there are points that we may say hey I don't like that or I think that would be differently stated or or it sucks or whatever you want to say it's fine I don't take umbrage with any of that so what this is a resolution of the Albuquerque Public Schools is concerning the following actions in response to an APS resolution of March 7th 2018 related to school shootings in the United States which is in the sport of the great City Schools resolution where is there is a need for nation's major public school system's Express their positions on school safety matters that affected students and the children residing in the cities and whereas the leaders of the nation's major public school systems respect the concerns of their students and support the growing Civic and social participation of its students whereas students across the nation of publicly expressed concern for their safety and have indicated that policy makers should act immediately to protect them in school

[01:25:00]
where is school should plan for the possibility of such acts of violence coordinate with law enforcement and secure their buildings from Intruders where is the Albuquerque Public School District adopted a resolution on March 7th 2018 supporting the council great City Schools related to school shootings in the United States whereas in March 7th of 2018 resolution APS resolved to develop its own resolution along with community members as to how to improve Local School Safety and Security and where is APS as since LED and participated in meetings with community members and various organizations to analyze how to implement improve Local School Safety and Security related to such areas planning an education training for example related issues for example mental health restorative justice invention hardening of schools for example of security and safety meth

[01:26:00]
and communication coordination with other law enforcement agencies for example Albuquerque Police Department Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office where is the local APS students community members have questions to use of National Rifle Association Foundation funds in support of APs jrtc use primarily because the internet has not taken the leadership role in supporting root cause research and Associated legislation that might reduce gun-related violence in our communities in schools now they're for be resolved as advocacy Public Schools will not accept NRA takes a leadership role National leadership role in supporting actions that might reduce gun violence in our communities in schools and now therefore be a result of seeking support from other sources equivalent to the reduced generation with community members and organizations to

[01:27:00]
movement improved Local School Safety and Security and will support legislation that addresses improved School Safety and Security processes and facilities for New Mexico schools without a good funding to implement the legislation that is what I wrote so I'm opening that up for discussion with the board you can throw stones at it you can suggest changes you can whatever you like do I have comments you can be polite it's okay but I take photos accommodate some of the comments I had from the students I believe I tried to say something about leadership I still believe in my heart that probably ain't

[01:28:00]
could do more in leadership in terms of this area I think they got a great opportunity thanks a great organization and they have a great fan base so to speak if you like and they could take and have a great opportunity here to help lead this whole discussion and I think they could do that I think there's a disconnect in terms of what they want to do that or can do that or what the membership wants to do but I think they could whether we want to I mean they're not going to listen to APS let's put it that way you know it's not going to make a lot of difference what we say but I think again that's kind of the message I want to put to my students to say what is it you really want to enter to do you know if you're going to argue about it and say you don't like this organization tell us what you want them to do so I tried to kind of interpret how I thought maybe they might respond if they would do that so and I think in my heart

[01:29:00]
National leadership role in supporting actions that might reduce gun violence in our communities in schools so I'm looking for so I'm looking

[01:30:00]
what what does support look like what does what kind of legislation what are you looking at when I'm looking at support I got some you know looked at some things at the NRA said one of the things they said the stop School violence Act of 2018 and I hope a lot of you know about that so the NRA applauds the stop School violence Act of 2018 this bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by 100 366 Democrats 64 Republicans Barry bipartisan provides funding for training students teachers School administrators and local law enforcement to identify early warning signs that a person is a threat to themselves or others that sounds like getting to the root cause and his legislation that was passed included in the Omnibus Bill the NRA also said let's work together to secure our schools and stop School violence we protect our banks are sports stadiums

[01:31:00]
in our government buildings better than we protect our schools that must change that sounds like support to me so when we're saying they haven't taken a leadership role in supporting root cause research when I was looking at all the money that's coming through and this stop School violence act the Department of Justice has 213 million and I'm going to give you a little idea of of some of the things that that it does these are grants that are going to be given out it's going to fully fund the criminal background check system it's a good thing it's increasing funding for the US attorneys and Marshalls to address crime provides funding for justice programs that help Schools Kids Safe 75 million for school safety grants 94 for youth mentoring grants period 20 million for violent crime in gun reduction when we're saying they don't want to reduce gun

[01:32:00]
that's not what this is saying right here the project safe neighborhood which is also gang enforcement efforts 10 million for Valor which I'm sure some of you have heard of 10 million for police at Grants 4 million for gang and youth violence education and prevention no grant funding may be used to provide Firearms or firearm training maybe use for metal detectors locks lighting deterrent measure security assessments training a staff and students Mental Health Training emergency and response technology training to prevent student violence against self or others Anonymous reporting systems to school districts and Indian tribal organizations to implement the grants they are going to be distribute these across the US regions then also on top of that the Department of Education has 1.9 billion 90 for school safety activities that improve

[01:33:00]
safety and well-being during and after school to serve program that provides counseling and referrals for mental health services for schools affected by violence or traumatic crisis 1.1 billion for student support and academic achievement grants that support safe and healthy students including School Mental Health Services bullying and harassment prevention mentoring and School counseling and training for school Personnel on top of that the Department of Health and Human Services has another 71 million for project aware which I know you all know about that provides to promote resilience and communities facing civil unrest or to help with some first aid grants Mental Health First Aid grants 26 million for health transitions to provide grants to states to improve access to mental disorder treatment and support services for young people facing mental health conditions and my 13 million for the minority fellowship program

[01:34:00]
to improve Behavioral Healthcare outcomes for racial and ethnic minority populations which I know is very important to me 75 million to help expand the behavioral health Workforce including a rural and medically underserved areas and increase access to Child and Adolescent services so I just want to wonder where we're saying that they're not trying to and one it's not up to us for us to tell a group what their mission is or what their legislative agenda should be we don't like people telling us that we have no right to tell a private organization what it is but when we're trying to say that they're not supporting reducing gun violence that's so untrue so relative to the things in here that would be acceptable if we actually see what I'm trying to do is to get to the issue of is this really happening or not because

[01:35:00]
I don't want to have students come to me and say oh well here's all the stuff and then and then I'll have them or not have us in some way explain just like you have in some of these things about what really is going on what really is happening right so I think in terms of what you're saying is rather than saying I mean I don't have any problem saying that that they've questioned us doing this but now and their question was because they didn't believe that he was doing anything okay so now the question is well maybe what we need to say is is the evidence isn't from everything that I've tried to get to the airport

[01:36:00]
here is that I'm trying to capture the essence of what I'm hearing from the complaint and so now the question is is do we have evidence do we have some information here that we can provide to say wait a minute there are some things that going on maybe maybe some people don't think there's enough or maybe whatever I mean they can always have never be happy with it but the question is do we have some actual information in evidence that says what really is being done can we provide that information particularly when you want to talk to our students about it right because we want to educate them too as well alright we don't want to just go off and say so the question is is that right or not right is really good friends

[01:37:00]
that's why I say this is the message I'm hearing so now the question is is is is is this right or do we have a way to help educate our public here a little bit as well as our students about some things that are going on and educate them also on what the NRA does as some of the people who spoke tonight they're Eddie Eagle works with has worked with like tens of millions of children so it does the same thing as when you're teaching them stop drop and roll so it's I think it's like stop don't you know 28 million and never in that if you look at their video Eddie Eagle Treehouse never does Eddie Eagle ever touch a gun and then I think somebody spoke to the National School Shield that I mean there are so many programs a youth wildlife art contest that gives tons of scholarships you know gives Awards out their scholarship programs building the Next Generation

[01:38:00]
do you know youth Cooperative organization teaching a healthy outdoor lifestyle there's so many things that they do that are good and we're vilifying them when there's no reason to vilify them and if we need to look at what they are giving to our students do we want to hold all organizations to the same standard do we want to say let's see how many of your board members are this or how many of your employees are this come on do we really want to do that and and when I talked with the students there were some incorrect statements about the perceptions of the students actually go to college by 92% actually

[01:39:00]
do I go to college they're being taught leadership roles and so forth says there are a lot of really positive things right they have a great youth Summit the NRA does that as well teaching Leadership Learning I mean there's just so many things that we're just choosing to to ignore and we shouldn't be nobody wants a child to die but if we're looking at nobody does I know what that feels like no I would not want to wish that on any parent ever sure absolutely deal with directly here and we can't really say exactly from a national point of view what ought to be done necessarily because there's so many complexities or whatever so yeah so those are some of the

[01:40:00]
first I want to thank you all who came this evening to speak your heart speak your mind I'm not completely familiar with these issues and I appreciate it the resolution because I think it's a starting point I think Community dialogue is part of Community Education and there's not much dialogue happening these days mostly what you get is people posturing and righteously pointing their fingers in one another's face and there's not an opportunity to talk I don't know about all these issues I am not a gun owner nor do I keep alcohol in my house and that's for a very personal decision

[01:41:00]
and you can basically conjecture what you like from there but I'd rather not use either I think it's a very personal decision I think that we as a board of education should be in a position to say we need to have a community dialogue about all of these things to be able to sit down together and grow in our awareness and understand each other and begin to move us forward we do have a problem with gun violence in this community it is not the kind of problem that we read about often thank God and I hope and pray that we never end up in that kind of situation but mostly the violence that we see is in our families suicide if you have a gun in your household you increase exponentially the chance of

[01:42:00]
who won dying in that household where are we in terms of issues like where are we on the idea of perhaps we could all rally and say that every time we have a gun seller here every time someone buys a gun they should be required to buy a gun lock that certainly would save a number of violence and death in our communities not to say that everyone would do that but I think that we have to find a way to get a handle on this and that would be one of the things that I would be interested in talking about if we had a dialogue you know I am irritated with the fact that we have a standard issue hollow point bullets for our police force our APS police force and our APD police force and the fact that a matter is you can't hunt a deer with the hollow point bullet without a bunch of people getting upset about it

[01:43:00]
but it doesn't seem to matter when it comes to what happens and how gun violence has been impacting our communities of color poor communities working class communities we've had a number of police killings in this city and I'm very concerned about that you know it's helpful to hear the issues as they were clarified by Scott I had no idea I tried to find out how much money were receiving and you know it's very difficult when when you don't know what we're supposed to approve the budget I don't ever remember approving any of those grants how it is a grant can go to an individual school and not come through our budgeting process is something that makes me shake my head and say what what's going on here and I just want to say that

[01:44:00]
the NRA has taken regressive stands they forced the Dickie Amendment which essentially set it up so that in Congress an amendment was made to a piece of legislation by a former legislator in Congress that basically implied that the CDC could no longer do research on gun violence and there's something wrong with that there's something wrong with that and that was intimidating and I disrespect that mentality I do not see that as playing Fair we have to move forward here and I'm willing to admit my ignorance but I think we have to begin to find a way to start from 0 Let's down and let's talk

[01:45:00]
let's begin to see what we can do to dissect this issue as it applies to us locally and as we move forward you know from what Scott said this evening I don't have a problem with the money that the NRA has given to our schools but I do have a problem with the fact that we can't seem to have a dialogue we need to research what we can do to prevent these acts of gun violence I don't know how many people who committed gun violence are graduates of JROTC are our members of NRA or any of that stuff I don't know but I do not well I was I distinctly heard this evening that the most recently the young person who was involved in the shooting in Florida was a member of JROTC know if that's accurate okay I don't know if it's accurate a number of your hands head so you may have more information

[01:46:00]
but I'd like to find a way to have a dialogue so we can get this sorted out as an opportunity to educate as well as Empower our community to prevent some of these misunderstandings but also to help us move forward so that's what I'm coming from on this thank you thank you very much but it doesn't mean that I don't support individuals who want to have a gun or be a responsible gun gun gun owner I grew up with a family that there were family members that hunted responsibly carried guns responsibly so that's you know and it was so I support that that side of it my question was I mean I guess when I'm looking at

[01:47:00]
you know I look at the resolution and it says has not taken a leadership role in supporting root cause and research it's it's a tough one because I like board member Garcia I'm sort of somewhat ignorant on that too I don't know how much they have or have not done I agree with you know what what we do know is that you know with the with the fight or the the against things such as CDC studies that one's difficult for me because I you know I am a public health person use epidemiology all the time to study things like the hickler crashes DWI crushes all of these things and gun violence in the United States issue it's something that we're growing up with but that all said also being on a board member it doesn't it's not about

[01:48:00]
I'm pro-gun or anti-gun or I'm this or I'm that I'm here to support students and the reality is is that I'm here to to support students on both sides of this issue so it's for those students that are all so fearful about gun violence and the fact that they're afraid of coming to school because they fear that they don't understand it but I also support the students that you know are interested in being Civic leaders and getting all the things that they're getting through JROTC I've had family members that have gone through ROTC and it's been a it's been an important piece for them I applaud the the opportunities for leadership and learning to be responsible Etc personally I don't understand why you have to have guns in the mix but that's me personally so I get that part so with that said I mean I do in terms of my thoughts

[01:49:00]
on the on the resolution I also believe that it is about having a discourse because if we can't have a communication about it on both sides because I want to respect the students on both sides and I think the most joyful or the most the best opportunity that we could have out of this if nobody else can do it in the country because we seem to not be able to is that wouldn't it be wouldn't it be awesome if our students who are on both sides of this issue could actually come up together and actually work this out and we had something that addressed and respected the rights on each side because they both have the right to feel safe and the right to be respected for their position I have a different opinion and I have several family members that have a different opinion but we still love each other and we can still have a discourse so why can't we do that here also at school so I

[01:50:00]
I'm not sure yet on where I stand on the way that the resolution is being written at this point so I'll start with my disclaimer that my father was a lifetime member of NRA and they were always guns in our house and my sister's family lives in Alaska and they do all of those things but it has nothing to do with what we're talking about here and that's that's what it comes down to and I have no doubt but what the people who came here tonight to speak on both sides come with honesty and good intention but the fact is that the bill that the was passed by the house his suddenly disappeared that there were Parts in the house bill

[01:51:00]
that were in there with the knowledge that it wouldn't be acceptable in the Senate and that all of a sudden it's gone underground that the funding that was talked about hasn't been made available it hasn't moved forward that there's been no backing up on the opposition to being able to study from a scientific basis the effect of gun violence and that we are in exactly the same place we've been in for the last 10 years and I think that one of the aspects one of the strengths of the resolution is it's not saying anything at all about who's sitting in this room in the intention of the people sitting in this room it's saying that nationally the NRA is playing a very active role in how Federal legislation in policy is being enacted in past and so all of a sudden mysteriously the

[01:52:00]
people who give voice to saying yes we want to fund smaller class sizes let's look at what would really make a difference smaller class sizes stronger relationships between the human beings that are involved in schools more counselors all of those things yes Universal background checks that overwhelmingly the the community in the US supports all of those things suddenly don't get acted on and when real when the issues of sufficient funding come up Suddenly the voice isn't there for those things so I support this recipe

[01:53:00]
that the voices here tonight are not at all reflective of the voices that I've been hearing that have come to me from through emails and phone calls that that's not to say that the voice of people who are here tonight aren't absolutely just as legitimate but I want you to know that you're all that this is also not number Weis reflective of who's been contacting me and and what the will of the community is to Great extent so more conversation is fine but the other thing that I want to say and one of the little bits that I truly appreciate is that schools are one of the safest places you can have your children that the factors that are schools are safe and that one of our roles

[01:54:00]
is to make schools open and welcoming and so when we start talking about hardening our schools the other side of that challenge is to let the community know that schools belong to them in the community is welcome and so schools are in this conundrum of how do we make sure that they're safe how do we make sure students feel safe but how do we also convey the fact that schools are living breathing part of the community and so I really appreciate the work that Mr Elders been doing of trying to not just your reactions and buy lots of stuff that looks good and doesn't do anything to do with what's really going to make school safe which in talking to students it means having the trust and respect

[01:55:00]
in the communication with staff members in the building being able to develop those relationships being able to know that you can if you see something that there is a safe person you can go to and talk to that that there are positive Human Relationships that we can build on and that's what we have to focus on so I'm I'm happy to delay action on this but it's not to say that we don't have a position that we feel strongly about I mean I want to hear if if everything that was said tonight about the NRA is true that I want to hear them leading not just sitting back but where's the leadership both in Santa Fe about saying what is sensible what is reasonable what is sufficient funding if we want some gun control

[01:56:00]
but then not be there when it comes down to what really is an active working solution because I don't believe they have been and I think that there's lots of evidence of that fact that the other has passed a bill and where is it now thank you very much I don't even know where to start I feel like we are constantly divided by outside but but I agree with Lorenzo I mean I really believe we need more

[01:57:00]
play dialogue around this it needs to be our community that talks about what works best for us it needs to be our students that Express their fears and their concerns and we as adults we as students need to work together to figure out what those Solutions are because we all come to the table right with our own values and beliefs and the sources that you say about the NRA are going to be different than the sources I cite about the NRA and because we have these outside influences and we have these outside beliefs but that that's not going to help our community move forward it's not going to help our students move forward and feeling safe so I really feel like we need to have more Community dialogue I can easily place my vote tonight but I think really we need to go back to what Lorenzo said and we need to have more Community dialogue and this wasn't about cutting the funding from our JROTC program you know I

[01:58:00]
proud that my son participated in JROTC when he was in Washington Middle School and was Cadet the year 2 years in a row I mean he still has those leadership skills to this day I'm incredibly proud of him but yes I can easily vote against receiving funding from the NRA but it's not it's not about me it's not about the values and beliefs that I bring but it's about us coming together as a community with all of these different beliefs and values that we have and working on better solutions for this community not from our national outside influences that every fucking day tired tired of giving us their their their opinions I mean

[01:59:00]
let's come together as a community and work on Solutions there's another side of this issue as well and all of it needs to be valued let's quit being divided on everything so that's my comment thank you very much I appreciate your comments I appreciate the information and so thank you so much but we have a responsibility is board members is greater we have students and families out in the community as we actually represent

[02:00:00]
higher District a families and students and I think it is important and it is incumbent upon us to listen and have a dialogue like a board member Garcia sorry to pick on you so much Larry I'm sorry but I think you know sharing what you're doing out in the community as well Scott Mr Elder is as the as part of APs I don't think I ever hear some of these things that APS is board member and I think that is very important for transparency out in the community I think it would be very important to hear what apses doing have a report at wraps board meeting I think that would be important in terms of the community feeling like they know what APS is about they know what is looking like in this community I think it would be very important for us to hear this

[02:01:00]
report that you just provided if we could hear that on a regular basis that would be helpful I'm not sure they're bringing it to the copt committee the capital outlay planning and Technologies committee would you know I don't know that everybody knows about this or pulls up the computer to look and see what it is we're doing so I think that's a start and I think that would be helpful and in terms of the resolution I am I think if we could postpone this so that we can have you know like we've been talking about a dialogue with the community would be helpful I think if we could postpone action on it today that would be my recommendation at this point and I want to thank you for your leadership as well period thank you so much thank you very much one of the things I want to do

[02:02:00]
and I think I have probably done that is to create a discussion here a little bit you know about what some of the issues are what we're thinking and what we've heard you know we all have different things you've heard and things we haven't heard and I wanted the community to start start telling me about where we are I want the students to tell me where we are you know what I want I want to hear about that and I don't want to dismiss anything particularly I've tried to say in the past I'm not sure the real issue is about how do we really go about making this better you know and everybody needs to work together to make it better you know I mean I think it helped but I think we can help and I think the students can help I think the community and and so I do like the idea of a little more discussion I mean

[02:03:00]
and yet I'm I'm kind of impatient you know I'm one of those people that after you've talked to me for a while what are we going to do here period And I think that's that's a little bit about what the nation's about to you know what are we really doing anything are we just going to continue to talk about stuff are we going to continue to talk about stuff you know and and try to have all the little interest and I think our students are really saying they don't know really what to do they just are saying can you guys do something here you know can you really do something that's really I think that however we can influence to get something done you know and and I think that's that's to me and again you know I don't know that

[02:04:00]
little discussion here is going to make a difference in DC but it might make a difference here it might make a difference in Albuquerque and make a difference in what we're doing right and if we do something who knows where that might go you know things start little usually they don't start with the big picture they usually start by somebody actually doing something and somebody else saying hey that's a good idea you know and then it grows so I think our community is one that needs to discuss and talk about this and we'll see what we need to do you know I like that I think we got a lot of good people here and I think we got a lot of people who are smart enough to help make good decisions

[02:05:00]
what came to school and they had racks of guns in their trucks and they went hunting sometimes and they did whatever and nobody ever got shot you know nobody ever got shot the only person that ever died from anything was was an arrow that was shot through a haystack because it happened to go through the whole Haystack and somebody was in it unbelievably and you know statistically incorrect being on the other side that's the only one country it was because my dad was a guard on the railroad for six months

[02:06:00]
and I asked my mother I said you mean my dad carried a gun he's had never ever hurt my dad ever talk about a gun so so guns you know have a place they have a place in our society but they also have a place not in our society so let me ask the the we wish to the board game do you think we need to put this out it doesn't have to be acted on it can be something that people can talk about I don't care we can postpone this any action on this weekend I've heard several different things about the mostly I've heard a little bit about maybe

[02:07:00]
any more discussion with the community maybe not necessarily taking direct action here what is the idea of the board in general personally I'm happy to move for approval but listening I mean the primary thing was the fact that students would like to be here and aren't and I think that having an opportunity to hear from a broader voicemail opportunity to talk is important not to Discount all of the voices that were here but we need to hear the human beings that walk into those schools every day and what is it going to the real intention of having it back on the agenda later on

[02:08:00]
that

[02:09:00]
was was to strike the paragraph that followed that that said that we would not accept the NRA funds and then go to the next one which just said now therefore it be it resolved at the Albuquerque Public Schools values its JROTC program and therefore will continue to support equivalent to to I don't I think what I'm trying to say is like not necessarily stating that we're going to we're going to like get rid of the funding but we can continue to support it but we're also acknowledging that we're valuing the questioning of those funds because I think what it is is what I'm trying to say is that it's sort of just recognizes that in our discourse in this process we're going to listen to both sides and both sides so that our resolution says we're not getting rid of JROTC

[02:10:00]
we're not doing that because one of the things that I was concerned about is and this goes back to like each of the local clubs it sounds like they're doing their own fundraising is that Scott I mean that's what I was thinking they're doing their own fundraising so they're riding for Grant so that they can have funds to support their programs at that level correct and so like other clubs they're all going out and they're looking for ways to get you know to get funds I mean a great positive thing could be as if the leadership from you know NRA funds for that is that a JROTC program could actually you know apply for funds that was going to be used for you know identifying root causes or like dealing with metal health or something like that because they wanted to do a leadership on that now wouldn't that be awesome if they actually funded that I mean so what I was my concern is that I didn't want to take away their ability for fundraising cuz I know how freaking hard it is

[02:11:00]
but I also wanted to acknowledge the fact that we are indeed acknowledging that there is a question about that and so it sort of takes that into account and we put both of those groups together so we can talk about and the students as a leaders could come up to to also talked about what does this mean for fundraising what does it mean to actually pull the groups together so that there's some understanding between each other and the ways that we can go and maybe test it I would love to see a student group tested and actually submit a grant for something that would be on the opposite side or that would appear that it's something not the opposite side but that would appear to be something that is actually sort of like a lead project and it had you know it's cohesive of both voices I don't know that we can accomplish that that was what I was thinking is just striking that paragraph that we would you know that we're not going to accept the NRA funds because

[02:12:00]
I just don't really know what that means right exactly so that could be framework looking at other resources well I think again I'll just follow up with that just because just to make it consistent is instead of saying because the NRA because again we're not trying to say we're saying that we're trying to say kind of this the group is giving us perception as well have to say take out the reduced NRA

[02:13:00]
get finding from other places maybe but you know we don't not necessarily saying we're taking yes Scott Peterson members of the board game board member card if I need to point out they're not a club they are co-curricular activity they are class right I believe that the friends of the NRA really looks at mission-specific but they're they're granting of their funds are the most time when we go out you know the art Department goes out and seeks funds from local art collaboratives since you are talking about a conversation you know we tend to be very reactionary and so one group shows up and we react to that the next to that and you are talking about a conversation perhaps we could talk with some of these funding sources about what they might be willing to to political arm of the NRA and these

[02:14:00]
play local New Mexicans you know perhaps these maybe they're willing to support the leadership programs I'm thinking about the sale camp and you know I don't know enough and like I apparently left so but I'm just saying if we're going to have a conversation then let's have a real conversation with the people that have taken the time and and the energy to sit through one of these meetings and and ask them what they might be willing to do because maybe we don't have to buy you know air rifles solely with those funds maybe we could look at other opportunities and other options that might work for that group might not have their own mission to work with people that have been very very generous to us and very very willing to work with our students so sure and I think to some extent that's that's that's that second paragraph from other sources

[02:15:00]
but I think it's saying how do we actually kind of continue this discussion a little bit you know and and see what we think about it that's what it sounds like to me what is saying is that you know it doesn't acknowledge the fact that there are some questions about this and that generally speaking we need to continue to discussion on this which is kind of the last paragraph that we we really need to continue to work with our community in other words saying yeah this is what we can do now

[02:16:00]
are you in New Mexico what we actually can do here and let's work with our people here you know that's not worried necessarily about the national level because we can't really tell you the truth affect the national level anyway other than who we send the Congress and we got two or three you know not many so you know that's the kind of the idea there's just so much energy in time on our beliefs and our values and if we could bring it to the community make sure you're okay you make sure I'm okay if we can take it to the community level and figure out what works best for Albuquerque I mean these are our parents these are our community and if there is a way for us to work together that tearing each other down and having just respectful conversation

[02:17:00]
can you use the f word again well maybe but I know I promise that before but I just want to figure out a way to have Community dialogue where we respect one another at the end of the day I'm your next door neighbor and that's what matters I'm taking care of your children we're taking care of each other and you know if we could just put we have so much outside noise every single day and I'm not at the end of the day I need to step back and we need to bring more Community dialogue and we need to just each one of us bring something special to the table and we need to figure out the solution together let me suggest that let me take kind of the conversation that we've heard here let me read this a little bit in terms of some of the ideas and thoughts here

[02:18:00]
let me see if I can make a little more Albuquerque specific you know in terms of what we would do here I can work with Scott a little bit to say what are we going to maybe do specifically in terms of you know I made it pretty General cuz I didn't want to commit the staff here to anything particularly you know they kind of looked at what I first wrote and says what are you committing us to hear you know I was committing a message to the National leadership role of of possible solutions so I could do that and when the other students get back or when we have the opportunity to meet with him this whole time thank you very much for being here you know I I got a couple emails and I and I hope I was just for and said hey Google

[02:19:00]
you know what I mean so I appreciate that greatly because I think it is important I think it is important to hear what we really are doing and you know when we have our communities here that are really trying to work with our kids and to help our kids and to do that that's the that's the point isn't it it's not it's not the outside it's what are we doing here and so I think that's important one of the things that I want to make this has been a wonderful discussion not easy but but really very interesting and I'm sorry that the students are not here because if they had been here they would have been able to see us modeling the very thing that we want to teach them experience talking about experiences sharing those being respectful of what we hear having people that are coming from the community who care

[02:20:00]
enough to come here and share their information with us and how we are willing to stop everything and really take time to listen and dialogue I don't think we could have a better lesson plan than that to be able to share with our students thank you I thank you for your commitment I agree and I think to take a little bit of a of a lead from what Scott said and he said you know let's try not to just take a reaction let's think about this a little bit let's talk about it a little bit I like I said I'm a little impatient all the time I like product I like to get things done I like to make progress but progress a lot of time is made over time it is not necessarily made in an instant of reaction and I think I think one of the things I like about what we're doing in APS now is

[02:21:00]
is it weird trying not to be so reactive we are trying to actually be thoughtful and and programmatic and strategic in terms of what we're doing and so I think again you know from an action kind of point of view let me let me take this I think again I've heard a lot of really good things but we could also sell tonight's session for 34.99 and

[02:22:00]
and we probably just need more conversation to see what we're doing so I think that's kind of weather like to do here so we'll postpone this I will take the action to kind of work with this so I can work with some of you again you know and some other things about it cuz we need to have probably some background evidence to talk about well you know when you tell me anyways doing this we got some things here but other people say we got some things there okay so is there or should we be talking about Scott's doing and so those are all the things that I think we need to put together so thank you very very much I was very nervous about this because I didn't want to be a bad situation I wanted to have a creative conversation you know I think it was like if we could have had students here in a

[02:23:00]
and respectful way to have some you know some of this discussion and also to hear hear it you know and hear the board members talk about these I think that's a good thing so maybe in the future we can we can do that a little bit more I didn't really get quite as much contact information about the people I talked to I got some names but I didn't really get emails I didn't get something I could really communicate with him you know I thought maybe they would communicate with me because it's easy to find me the way you know but so I will probably do that here and see if I can work with him a little bit and see if we can work out some things to talk about but I appreciate that thank you very much everybody appreciate all your comments so let me go on I know we've got some other items here board member comments or we had enough comments or do you want to come in about obviously you were never at

[02:24:00]
I can tell you right now I know exactly where I was I was actually watching the TV of them going through and then all of a sudden it came on that he had been shot in the kitchen I said what I was watching the TV

[02:25:00]
amazing

[02:26:00]
Hawthorne and thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart to Dr Gonzalez and Dr Blakey and the staff at the schools because they have been under assault and have more than risen to the occasion and deserve incredible recognition for that the great completely I just want to add that another celebration for us over at the Department of Workforce Solutions we kicked off our internship program for the summer and so we have some students from Rio Grande and also one from Sandia that came through and so yesterday they kicked off with the today's Wednesday so it was Monday and Tuesday they had two full days of orientation so I had a chance to sit in with the students and it was just amazing we they had an opportunity to

[02:27:00]
to go through what we call sort of a mini new employee orientation so they were learning about all of the things that are associated with being part of a bureaucracy you know like the sexual harassment awareness training to the security awareness training that they all had to go through but what was really impressive is after we had finished this they had an opportunity to ask the students you know what were their thoughts in terms of what was going on and there was one young student who said this is really been great because we really felt like we had an opportunity to actually share our voice about what we think about about work and what needs to happen so we're really looking forward to it it's going to be our agency has actually participated in this for this is our sixth year and it's a six week in internship it's a paid internship too I want to say that for our students so they're placed in Our IT department but they're all placed throughout

[02:28:00]
we're in our Workforce Connection centers working there as well and then we have a couple that are actually in our legal department so it's it's it's it's just really wonderful to see the students are impressive OK Google

[02:29:00]
your personalities I just had got some emails and something from a couple of constituents so Derek Scott just wanted me to pass on that his son Alan wants to be a part of ROTC and apply for scholarships to try to get on to to school because he couldn't afford the education any other way so I said I would pass that on and that I would read this from a former APS students my name is Caroline ones and I would like to speak on behalf of the JROTC programs and the funding you're looking at cutting the Eldorado TC was a program that allowed me to thrive in high school and grow the things that this program taught us were more than we

[02:30:00]
could have found anywhere else a taught us leadership community service discipline and a sense of belonging that is a big deal to a lot of high school students we were more than a high school program geared to keeping us out of trouble we were a family a community that supported one another and were each other's biggest cheerleaders JROTC allowed us to find our place and guide us in a sense of accomplishment as we went through high school I was a part of the JROTC Shooting Sports and before that a part of 4-H shooting sports both which receive funding from the friends of the NRA because of that I had opportunities I couldn't have dreamed of I competed all over the United States I had college scholarship opportunities thanks to my Shooting Sports Talent JROTC is more than a political agenda it provides you a skill set not only to further you in high school but in life as well I understand the politics being driven by the urge to cut the funding from the NRA but please let me explain where this money truly comes from before you make a decision while many see it is coming

[02:31:00]
from the NRA it comes from the friends of the NRA as you all understood tonight a volunteer-based community that works to raise funds within our state these volunteers work year-round to fundraise for this program a non-profit organization that gives back 100% of its proceeds since its Inception in 92 Friends of the NRA has close to 21,000 events has reached 4 million attendees and raise more than $815 million for the NRA Foundation the funding goes to many different programs 4-H ate Eagle Boy Scouts women law enforcement programs just to name a few fundraising efforts to the Friends of the NRA program allow the NRA Foundation to provide critical funding to educational firearm programs on the local state and National levels established in 1990 the NRA Foundation is funded over 45,000 grants become the America's leading charitable organization of the support of Shooting Sports do their efforts all friends

[02:32:00]
NRA supporters are making a difference by investing in the Next Generation please do not hurt or prohibit our future generation by taking away funding that gives them something that encourages them and gives them opportunities they otherwise couldn't have had so let me ask you this have you asked any JROTC Cadets with these grants have done for them the things that has allowed them to accomplish have you asked them what it means to them that wasn't the issue okay well I I don't have too much to say other than I did enjoy the Gordon Bernalillo Charter School graduation the 24 students the graduated and this one they have 70 total to graduated this year which is the largest they've ever had

[02:33:00]
it was it was a packed place to put it bluntly it was in a special Library Place off of Central and it was there I was there too and it was quite a family affair and it was very very interesting to you know they had the family members for 15 minutes or whatever system could learn a lot from what we're doing I think the ability to prepare our people who are incarcerated or whatever

[02:34:00]
with job skills with Workforce capabilities or the ability to have some pride and confidence and what they're doing and to go out and actually get jobs and to actually be contributing is where we ought to be going and that's where the Gordon Bernalillo Center is is helping us so I just think that's a great thing to say so appreciate it greatly all the comments from the board members tonight so with that I'll announce the upcoming meetings next week Wednesday June 20th here at 5:00 and the next special Board of Education meeting will be Monday June 2 5 t

[02:35:00]
and I will not be calling in I will not be here either so thank you and we are adjourned thank you Google
