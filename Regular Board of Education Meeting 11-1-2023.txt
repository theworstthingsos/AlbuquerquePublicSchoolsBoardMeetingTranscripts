[00:06:00]
High School part of his schedule to take an ethnic studies class during this class his teacher has brought up her political beliefs multiple times also talking bad about the past president it went too far about a week ago when she compared Trump to Hitler and had multiple slides and pictures comparing the two this is very alarming I'm sorry but I don't believe that any US President should be compared to Hitler nor should this be taught in class she then asked all the kids who supported they make a movement as my son and one other boy raised their hand and the classmates mock them I'm concerned about the well-being of my son and the class and being and bullied what is this class for why is this class allowed to be taught not only that but the kids being mocked segregated and bullied all because of what they believe in is wrong we also found out that this class is not taught in all APS schools why real good on the high school why are the teachers allowed to openly share about their political beliefs and said

[00:07:00]
sticking to the curriculum or is this part of the curriculum that would be alarming if it is my son wanted nothing more to the attend Rio Grande High School to be part of the ROTC program in hopes to one day join the military and Serve and Protect this country this is wrong and if this class is what this is about and the teachers segregating our children we need to remove this class from this from the school's immediately thank you when we appreciate you all the next speaker is Dr chanello have two minutes and transformation and they are my early

Thanksgiving gift to you guys there for serving APS and I appreciate you guys so Dr Richard to of Katella in New York City on October 12th 2023 Dakota is dangerous I know I know because I helped Pioneer it and quote my country and others found there is no solid evidence of supporting the medical transitioning of young people why are American clinicians paying attention Dr kathiyala 58 years old is the finished born in adolescent psychiatrist the Chiefs and the department of adolescent soccer at Finland temperature in University Hospitals in Kentucky 200 scientific articles in 2011 Dodge Dakota was a sign in your responsibility to see establishment of a gender identity service for minors making her among the first decision in the world to have a

[00:09:00]
devoted to the treatment of gender destruction people since then she has personally participated in the assessment of more than 500 such adolescents Dr call Thiele in 20 clinic and from nine countries wrote that and I called every systematic review of evidence to date including one published in the Journal of the endocrine Society has found the evidence for mental health benefits of hormonal hormonal intervention for minors to be of low or very low on Sunday and we need to learn from such Scandal because gender transition has gotten out of hand when Medical Professional start saying they have one answer that they have a cure for all of life pain that should be a one to us and school board members that's something has gone very long would you agree thank you thank you sir and our third person has not shown up so that completes public forum thank you

[00:10:00]
thank you so much for our two guests for coming in to speak tonight thank you for sharing your concerns and we will take a look at those so thank you our next item is do now comes Focus governance and we're going to be considering approval of the plan for the two Community engagement events schedule for November 13th and November 16th and I presenter is the chair of this ad hoc committee is Courtney Jackson Danielle Gonzales and Jose Dominguez you have the floor so you guys should have in front of you the draft Community engagement event that is focusing on the superintendent characteristics as well as the community outreach planning list so before we kind of dive into a discussion I just wanted to lay out with the objectives that we as a committee decided we wanted to address this evening

[00:11:00]
I'm just kind of give a timeline as to how we got here and then we can dive into a discussions on each of the objectives that we need to meet the first objective tonight is that we're going to present the community engagement timeline to all of you focusing on superintendent characteristics then we will present and get some number assignments to the community outreach planning list again for the superintendent search we will make a final decision on the attendance of Dr Walt Cooper to these community outreach events as a board we also need to decide and let Dr Albright know hopefully this evening who can attend which of the two events on the 13th and the 16th and then we'll just kind of touch on any essential timelines and dates so just as the brief

[00:12:00]
reminder is to how we got here the community engagement ad hoc committee is still working we met again on October 19th with the specific intent to create two community outreach events focusing on superintendent characteristics we the the goal was to set a time line to confirm which schools would be hosting to decide on the focus of the events to update any planning list that we have and to re-establish the community outreach planning list at that meeting we decided that the best way to move forward on the event was to start off with a brief recap of student outcomes Focus governance what we have done where we are going and why what we are focusing on with sfg why those characteristics for the are so crucial for our next superintendent throughout the planning document you can see that there

[00:13:00]
is a reminder that we are in sosg board and that because of that all of our decisions that we make will put student outcomes first so in this meeting we put together we just we decided to put together a timeline and a planning list it was built by two of the board members because one was traveling but then it was sent to all of the committee members on October 24th for review prior to us meeting again yesterday which is October 31st so we all had a week to kind of review that timeline then yesterday we met again to discuss the timeline and what was what was presented at that meeting was more of a cleaned up version of the one that was sent on October 24th mainly because the one on October 24th had abbreviation is an outline and just kind of wanted to clean it up for presentation we also began building out from that timeline building out a script

[00:14:00]
verbiage to the the timeline that we created and what's going to happen with that is right now the committee members are reviewing that script reviewing verbiage and the goal is that all the committee members will have edits by Friday and we will share that with the board prior to the event so moving to the first object sorry I'll stop there and board member Dominguez you have anything to add just that we are going to give the rest of the board that script before it's ever presented I think could you repeat those dates is it the third so the the committee will review the scripts until this Friday and then we will we we don't think we have a solid data storm we're going to send the script out yet for feedback

[00:15:00]
or at least to let them know I think to see it prior to but I don't know that the script needs to have board approval just the timeline yeah we won't have enough time for it to come back to the full board but it's an opportunity for every board member to see it before is what because I think what is important is just being able to look at it before we actually have to be at the event so right so because I know the last time we did this we got scripts and they were a little wonky I think we struggled with them a little bit but I have confidence that what you guys are pulling together is going to be a lot easier hopefully it's not as wordy and as difficult to follow so I appreciate the opportunity to take a look at it before the before the events okay so I'm bored Gonzalez are you are you there do you have anything on him all right so let's the first thing that we

[00:16:00]
wanted to present for recommendation to the board is the timeline which is in front of you the draft Community engagement event hopefully you have had a chance to kind of review it I am definitely not going to read it to you but what I can do is go through and just hit the highlights and then we can discuss if there are any changes so basically from 3 to 6 it's all about setting up we are wanting to potentially have some Community celebrities is how we're phrasing it at this event as a way to kind of draw people to the event who aren't necessarily just the parents of the student groups that are performing so we're still in the thought process of that so if anybody has great ideas please let us know 6:00 the event begins and it begins with another like a presentation on

[00:17:00]
governance that this is the district we are we are in now the goal is the guard rails the Strategic plan what the superintendent responsibilities are and what the Board of Education responsibilities are you can see we discuss the sosg we discussed the goals in the guard rails and then we move into a discussion of you know this is what we have done but now this is where we are going and we reiterate the fact that we are going to continue our community engagement and Outreach let them know that we have a two-year calendar that we've already committed to and progress monitoring then we will touch on this strategic plan and we will tie it all together with the Strategic plan video so again it's just a rehash of this is why SOG is so important and then we dive into the superintendent hiring timeline as well as the discussion so the first thing that we wanted to that we thought

[00:18:00]
we should do at the for the the actual conversation with the community is you can see down at the bottom is the very first turn and talk is where the prompt will be what do you not want to see in a superintendent and we've pulled that directly from our discussions with our coach through from Council of great City schools with this does is it helps to really drive to Clarity what you really are looking for it helps to avoid like this long list of like a unicorn person that were never just not possible right like I want somebody who loves Diet Coke but maybe that's not possible I don't know so that'll be the first discussion and then we will then move into more small groups of now that we've talked about what you do not want now let's kind of clarify that into what you do want in a superintendent

[00:19:00]
will let them kind of have those discussions and then they will turn to their small group and share those out you can see on here at the 6:45 time frame and this was brought to us by board members is that there really should probably be more of a process instead of just Consolidated into your top five so I did add in there that we could have a printout of the mac and mac and mac and cheese that is what was used here when you guys narrowed it down we thought that what I thought and it can certainly be a discussion that we could have that on the table but that's just more of an assistance is to how to narrow down the the characteristics because one thing that we really did want to point out is this has to be an authentic discussion coming from the

[00:20:00]
Community not a discussion that is driven by by the board so we will see at the bottom I did make a note board members are asked to refrain from giving their input and thoughts during the community conversations the characteristics coming from the community must be authentic so we have that and then we will move to a large group share out where each group will share the top three to five competencies we will capture all of those very similarly to what we did last year on posted some flip charts and all of that we will consolidate all of that and give it to somebody to Joanna then we'll move into closing comments again we're just focus on you know there are other ways to engage one thing that we will ask the attendees to do right then right then

[00:21:00]
send that survey out to five of your friends and as for doing that here are some giveaways and prizes and thank you for coming and so we'll share all the ways that you can continue to participate we will thank everyone and the event will end at 7:45 and we'll have everything taken down and completed by 8:30 so just to be clear on the two events sites so I noticed that it's not listed so the two events are so sorry West Mesa is on November 13th and it's always an issue with high school cuz there's so many different places cafeteria library library

[00:22:00]
we are going to ask students to help me we call him a human signs to help guide people to the right spot we don't have to know tonight I just know from many high school events if you don't know which building it is it can be a challenge but I do I will say that the last time we hosted these one of the things that I think our board staff did really well is that there was a lot of signage that got us to the right place so I have no doubt we'll be able to do that appropriately okay so Wesley's the first one on the 13th on the 13th and Manzano high school is on the 16th okay yeah okay oh and then just the the other thing to point out and that's at the very top of the document is just like last time two board members will lead each event other board members are certainly welcome to attend should attend but again it'll be two board members who will lead each of the each of the events so I think I'll pause right

[00:23:00]
Federal Credit Union Gonzales you're on is there anything that you would like to add before we move into larger discussion nope I think you can keep moving it no I think you've covered it all okay so any are is the board comfortable with the timeline as recommended by the committee we're going to have to be because I know we're moving really quickly and terms of the timeline around the search so I mean these events are really critical to get get out I just have a quick question around because I really agree with you in terms of board members not influencing the conversation right I mean because what I did hear from our search firm is how important it is for us for there to be some safety in the

[00:24:00]
room so that the individuals who are participating really feel free to have a conversation and almost even recommended that like board members not be present because sometimes we could also just influence the conversation that way so we really just have to really be very intentional on that so that there is this is their conversation and we need to be really clear about them being in charge of that conversation so I was curious who and who are we planning to use this table captains yeah so great question so we are going to have the community school coordinators will will be there as well however to just in an effort to increase that authenticity we are asking that the table decide their own table captains so that the groups can decide you know hey Community member who I've never met before would you like to be the table Captain if for some reason we have you know shy tables that's where the Community School

[00:25:00]
to facilitate those discussions okay but again they are also being trained trained when they show up that this is not this is not their conversation and that the responses to anything should be thank you so much and should be as generous as possible I mean I also feel like that needs to be part of the process at the end in terms of like summarizing things too I don't think it should be a board member sign summarizing anything I think we should be there to listen so I would recommend that you know there's also a lead somehow outside of us who's going to do that and I'm only saying this in my meeting with Dr Cooper before we had our our our our our Workshop I asked him this question about that authenticity and how that's done and he said that's really the that's that's a really critical point because then the community feels that they're being heard and so I know that

[00:26:00]
the search firm is actually been the one that's taken the lead on that to like just make sure that they're capturing that that it's authentic and that it's outside of somebody from the district and somebody who's perceived as having ownership of the of the conversation so I just want to I just want to bring that up to but we just need to be really cautious about that and when when you once the committee is done reviewing the script you will see that within the script it has we have inserted that language to the participants that we are here there's some there's an intention of stop stop others or suggestions I'm just going to make this

[00:27:00]
I was afforded a different conversation with Dr Cooper that happened before our Workshop I would like Dr Cooper to be at both of these and I'll tell you why Dr Cooper is going to be responsible for fielding that first recruit where it's like sharing that message but also tying it to what is being said by the community and rather than it just being sort of a roll up of here's the list of things that I've heard because I think it's a real visceral piece when you get to hear it yourself and when I spoke with Dr Cooper that is built into his contract and so he I mean he's he's really close by he's in Colorado Springs so it's not that difficult for him to get here and we could we could talk about that but I really think that that's that's important and I'm going to say this only because in the last search that I was a part of with the district we didn't do that

[00:28:00]
and I felt like it was very influenced by board members alone and so I think it's that reminder of somebody who's also listening to it because I think Dr Cooper did that with us as board members too as he was listening to our words and trying to to also put you know like paper and sort of thought about where we were but I would really like I would like to make that recommendation that we do have doctor Cooper attendees just so that he could be in the room and get that get it at that first hand piece because I saw that missing for us in the last search that we did we just didn't have that at all so that's the next bullet that we're going to make a decision okay but first we need to decide on the time sorry I think he's alone so I like the agenda and I like everything that's here

[00:29:00]
we need to do first right is we that the committee has recommended but we need to have approval from the board so I don't think I can make the motion so somebody would like to move for approval of the draft Community engagement event for superintendent characteristics that would be awesome I'll make a motion to move for the draft Community engagement event as listed out with the proposed timeline and activities Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson to make a decision on the attendance of Dr Walt Cooper and then

[00:30:00]
I will just kind of present the the the the the the thoughts from the committee and again if the committee wants to jump in please let me know we are we are at a split decision on this with two of us thinking that it's not necessary we don't need the extra cost what would the benefit be and the another one of us very much in the same bucket as you are so that is why we thought it was very important for us to bring it to the full board to make that decision on whether or not he should attend or not so I think I'll just open it up to the board to to add to add if you have anything extra to add from what board member Montoya Cordova just said so I don't have anything to add just a question like what would the cost be and where would it come the expense come from what president

[00:31:00]
the travel is already built into the contract so it would be no additional cost they have already budgeted for travel to here and we're well under the travel costs because we are closed and because he's been traveling primarily alone and not bringing people with him so it won't cost anything extra okay and nor will it save us money because it's already building this contract thank you I think it makes sense for him to be here to hear that because the importance of that initial searching the right people to bring in front of the board is huge and so I I agree that is important I weighed in I'm in favor of having sex

[00:32:00]
I don't see the harm of having it seems like it would benefit especially if there's no additional fees with that okay and remember Gonzalez do you have anything to add know it seems like there's consensus that people feel he should be here I think there's consensus I don't know that there needs to be a motion on that so and so consensus is that yes yes Dr Cooper will attend all right third bullet point we will move on to the community plan oh no I'm sorry real quick who can attend on November 13th assignments if you have not already sent your assignments to Dr Albright but if you can attend on the 13th and 16th please let us know so I plan on attending both but I will not be in I'll be incapacitated

[00:33:00]
so I won't be able to leave or okay so attend both not lead okay and I will say that I will attend both but not lead and my reason for doing that is because I'm an outgoing board member okay Crystal so I don't I could lead the 16th 13th we have our ad hoc Finance meeting happening and I know we finish at 4:30 a.m. so I can attend the 13th but I just can't be there as early as like for set up okay so okay we're never Gonzalez I can only attend on the 13th and I'm happy to lead on that one okay and lead and you'll also be at the ad hoc Finance so we'll just all run over there you don't 13th not on the 16th okay I

[00:34:00]
can I I can be at this the 16th I can help lead the 16th I don't know if I can be at the 13th we might be attending a funeral so I think you'll be able to make it for this for the 13th then because that's your District okay okay so right now it looks like Crystal and I will leave on the skipper all right so so possibly you can leave on the 13th and then we'll get we'll get with Peggy and see what her availability is as well so I heard board member Gonzalez say she was available to lead on the 13th yes okay yeah we have board member Gonzalez

[00:35:00]
board member Peterson for the 13th and then on the 16th it would be you and Crystal okay all right and I've got it all written down Dr Albright if you're listening and then we'll get with Peggy to see what her availability is to okay so moving on to the community planning list which is that big documents this is a list very similar to what we did last year this is the Outreach events and again these are Outreach events where two board members must attend in order for it to count as Outreach we already have two organizations who have requested it's the newcomers events and Dr all right I don't have the date on that okay the 18th Saturday

[00:36:00]
November 8th oh okay so we need to to board members who can attend that on the 18th I'm happy to attend okay remember Dominguez okay sadly I'll be out of town what time is it 4:45 on November 16th from 1:30 to 3:30 in the evening on that same day right so and I'm not leaving the 16th and I may be there okay

[00:37:00]
using the list from last year and just some of the organizations that we've reached out to so we certainly do not need to fill in the rest of this tonight but as you're looking through these organizations and you can find another board member to you and whoever else you choose to go okay who as you look through these organizations please get in contact with Dr Albright and so that she can start filling it in for us and as soon as we have the survey we need to start we need to start getting some Outreach and I would actually suggest that you start reaching out to these organizations Place 9:00 tonight as soon as

[00:38:00]
and we also created a very helpful email just a script email that you can send out it's super easy just cut and paste and say dear so and so we would like to meet with you or send out the survey so that's right there makes it super easy for you but this is another way for us to do some Outreach okay and just to recall everyone that this was the list that we had put together when we were compiling or wish list of organizations when we were doing community we it was kind of like I wish list if we were going to do community outreach events so if there's other organizations that have since emerge I think you just need to let Christy know or because this list is very exhausted but it doesn't mean that we need to hit them all but it's just a potential list of Outreach organizations

[00:39:00]
I'm not playing I would just add there are the neighborhood associations which are listed at the bottom and what I did there was just take them from the top and pasted them on the bottom under a header of neighborhood organizations so it doesn't mean those are the only neighborhood associations identified for outreach if there is a neighborhood association in your community for example North Valley neighborhood association I could add that the principal still applies that it needs to be too board members though you might want to consider the West Side Coalition that's a really active bunch and they always invite us to come speak they're very very open to APS and allowing us to be a part of that we will add that okay so please take a look at this list and just you know give your input to you can give it to myself Dr Albright or remember we can update the spreadsheet for

[00:40:00]
all the way until the applications are done I mean really it's through well not all the way through should probably be about the week before is what I would think but at least through the middle of December or that first week in December because we will have already missed one right I think more importantly just getting that letter out to any organizations that we had just inviting them into that survey and I do have an update on that but I'll include that in my presence okay and then just sorry anything else to add more remember to meet us thank you okay so just the final item is the invitation

[00:41:00]
most likely will be going out on Monday it will be translated so that it goes out in both English and Spanish so we're working on that that's in the final stages and I will take off the mention of the survey for your report yeah we can talk I think that's so that's all we have I don't think we need because we already approved the plans so we're good there so I think that's it I just have a clarifying question so as we're reaching out to these groups just so we're not duplicating efforts what's the best way to know if who's reaching out to who you need before you reach out you need to have you need to assign you got to be in the spreadsheet so do not reach out unless your name specifically is on the spreadsheet okay thank you Google

[00:42:00]
policies and transferring responsibilities to the administration and this is for this is 6.1 but we're archiving one through 10 and these are from the October 16th 2023 policy committee meeting do I have a motion

[00:43:00]
word board policies and transferring responsibility to the administration for 1 through 10 seconds for discussion and action is consider adoption of the guard rails for the board and unfortunately the board member that requested to have this removed you know off consent and for discussion isn't with us tonight but we could let's just have a conversation in this before it's an opportunity for board member top of Romero since you weren't here with us last time when we considered this through the policy committee so

[00:44:00]
let's go ahead and have some discussions we have Jessica Martinez I guess is going to give us an update on terms of where we are Focus government you have considered adoption of the board's own guardrails but your actions that the board may not take or allow in pursuit of the district schools so tonight at the board will consider final approval for its own self guard rails and with that the roads are open for discussion is there any discussion I'm going to turn to board member only because I feel bad because you were here with us last time is like just if you want to give your thoughts on that we could capture that have it for the record but these were I believe we were Smith I'm going to ask board member Gonzalez I think these are these were Smith's a little bit but not a whole lot I think they're I think they're all pretty

[00:45:00]
no I don't have any back to when I saw this I think my question was I didn't we already discussed this no I'm good okay any other comments or questions on the card rails there was only one question that was posed and that was on the first one I'm going to I'm going to do this in in honoring the the board member that's not here was around that whole you know how would we know about each other's assumptions and intentions and my response was going to be the way that we know about each other's assumptions and intentions is really on our integrity I mean we are the ones that have to hold that and do that and I actually had even written something about this but let me pull it up really quickly because at the sosg training man did we have a huge conversation about assumptions and you know how we can get ourselves on that so

[00:46:00]
we don't think much about it but we go through our daily lives with a huge range of assumptions about what is going on around us at least I do and I expect you to the activities of strangers remind us of the existence of other people and how their lives are different from our own and sometimes we create stories in our minds about what is going on and our initial assumptions can be very wrong so before and you know being the Genesis of change under sfg and doing this part before I make a decision about you I will do my best to be mindful of how my personal assumptions may be creating a story about you that is not true and my wish is that you do the same if you are unsure about something you believe to be true about me just ask me and so I think that's part of the the peace with this whole intention on this card Rail and it I feel like there's consensus with this group here on this and it's important

[00:47:00]
on this particular piece if I learned anything at all from the s o f g piece the guard rails for the board is really where we do want consensus because this is about us and this is important for us to have agreement on everything that we stayed here because these are the things that we're going to agree to do together all right I just want to add the part of as I was part of the cohort in San Diego that particular section on assumptions prompted this was good because AJ required us to do something during the break and that was great because I reached out to my partner in the cohort Courtney and we had

[00:48:00]
conversation about an assumption that I had made so and I think it was fruitful right I mean we got things clarified and so really it is it is about suspending assumptions and then being curious having a sense of wonder which is the first step in the Socratic method that many English teachers use full circle I'm glad that I had a chance to do that I'm planning to take my learning to a different level since I'm not going to be on the board but I am still committed to to board members and so anyhow so here we are on this action item and so

[00:49:00]
is up for consideration for adoptions so I will entertain a motion Gonzales Jackson is considered approval of the Board of Education governance manual and I want to disclose on this I pulled it off a consent because I wanted us to have a deeper conversation about it there was so much going on in the policy meeting that we had a lot of changes there was a flurry of conversation going from all over the place and again this government

[00:50:00]
it's manual is about us this is about the work that we do together in terms of how we govern ourselves and where we got ourselves hung up was really around the issue of recusal and the whole notion of that transparency when there is a conflict I had a great conversation with board member Gonzalez this morning where we had a chance to sort of clarify some of those those pieces in my mind but what I left with after that meeting is that I was not happy that it just left sort of some of us feeling very unsettled because this isn't a place for us to be unsettled this is a really important piece and so when I go back and I look at the whole issue of recusal and we took out the language so on the gifts section for example we'll start first with the gifts section we put a limit on there what it was 250 dollars we have to report that

[00:51:00]
back and board member Gonzalez help me remember this this morning but we said yes we would report the gifts but we didn't say and recuse ourselves and so and what I want to remind everybody is that language and recuse herself doesn't necessarily mean that there's going to be somebody on here who's going to say you need to recuse yourself because the recusal comes at the level of us and our integrity this is about us as individuals and making that decision is the conflict do I have a perceived or a real conflict on this I'm going to recuse myself and so it's us at our decision making that that piece at that point on the gifts I like the idea of the gifts and I think we all had agreement on that in terms of the gifts section that that $250 do you want to add anything else to that and then we'll get to the next one because I think this is the first one right

[00:52:00]
thank you I think the only thing I would add is just in terms of specificity so it is an impact I think part of what was confusing as we did a lot of wordsmithing and reordering as well so in for us the code of conduct its number three where we say board members will adhere to the provisions of the New Mexico Gift Act and then we also say board members will if board members receiver except loans or gifts over 250 dollars they will disclose it to board services and pure board members what we don't have in here to president's point is that we will accuse ourselves from any votes relating to the individuals or organizations that have provided the gifts and so if we were to make a specific Amendment which I would do as a friendly Amendment proposal tonight is that we add that language there to number three just another sentence that says board members will refuse from votes related to individuals or organizations that have provided them gifts over 250 dollars in part because that's not a part of the New Mexico Gift Act the New Mexico Gift Act is very specific

[00:53:00]
and maybe a little convoluted but it doesn't actually say that local officials like us would have to recuse and so I would just make that specific request for number three and that's on page I'm like 11:00 okay so I'll open it how do people let's just stop with that one how to folks feel about that amendment to that particular one so I do have a question I mean this is what I brought up the last time I went to New York to conference that was sponsored jointly by the American Federation of teachers and the the National Coalition for Community Schools and so that was paid for by me what does that mean I have no problem reporting that I think

[00:54:00]
any I mean all of us probably a 10 Things I know Peggy goes to nello conferences I don't know if any of that portion for her is it paid for hopefully we all go to conferences of one sort or another the defense are knowledge so where does that lie when we say what kind of gift what kind of I mean I think that's the only thing I can point to that even comes close to a gift that's that's I mean I can't even think of any others but I think it needs clarification because it leaves open does that mean I can't ever vote on Community School calendar or community school policy if my understanding has been

[00:55:00]
and by going to this conference and I'm sure I mean any number of us do attend one thing or another and have some portion of that paid for so when we start talking with you so I think it gets very gray and I think it can go into that level of assumptions and how we present not just ourselves but other board members to the community well I will and I will say that you're correct it is great so there isn't any any measure any definition any legal opinion that we're going to be able to get that's going to provide a clear black or white answer on that and so I think to board a president is about our own discretion our own decision and so I think in the example that you led should have vote on Community Schools come before the board you could certainly

[00:56:00]
do you say I just want to call out I had an opportunity to attend this trip that was sponsored by a community schools and you know however I'm going to vote on this because whatever you know but the amount was this or because I'm not it's not related to the specific Vote or I'm not going to benefit in any way there's a whole host of reasons why we might need to recuse or not recuse on any particular event but again there's there's no recusal police there's no enforcement it's us and I think the first step of this is really the transparency around reporting it and and publicly sharing it with our peers I think part of the part of the thing is that really we don't have any idea what each other is doing what trips are paid for by whom and so the first step really is that transparency piece so then I think is we get into it more will begin to figure out like maybe we do need to tighten language maybe we need to change it maybe we need to get a legal opinion maybe we need to something else but the biggest point is around

[00:57:00]
in public perception is there a chance that the public could perceive that me attending this trip paid for by this organization and then voting on an issue reflects the conflict of interest I think if there's a chance to pick the public might perceive that then I would refuse I think that is incredibly vague because our community has different perspectives and what what some portion of our community might perceive as a conflict of interest another portion of the community would not in fact might be supportive whatever she might be the very reason why they voted for us in the first place but I'd like I'd like to add a little bit to that though too so the policy we already have in place or the procedure that's already in place if there is a complaint about a perceived or

[00:58:00]
conflict of interest it does come to the board president it does I've already have already had an opportunity to deal with that and I just want to add this is just for context to I do want to add that in the entire time two years that I've been here doing this I've had only one that has come before us as a potential conflict of interest and we were able to to deal with that it's not it wasn't scary and it wasn't a big it wasn't huge I mean it's not that big So What I Hear What I Hear What I Hear is being proposed is that it's not a bad idea for us to be able to just say because it's already transparent in terms of who's making donations to us and that's the whole other section we already know who's making donations just because it's already public record we've already got that part listed out but what is not public record is who is supporting us in different ways in our own

[00:59:00]
professional development or the ways that were either getting gifts to support us either to travel or to the things I've never had that happen for me personally I just want to say I'm not even received a single scholarship I wish I had I do know I paid for a couple of things on my own but it's not it's not a horrible thing to do this because what I do like and what board member Gonzalez said is that it's just and will recuse yourself that is all up to us as board members still it is on us and one of the things that I am confident about with this particular board is that the Integrity that each and every single one of us brings to our elected position is there there is no doubt about that I have no doubt that every single one of us is taking our oath of office extremely serious and his sign that oath of office and our extremely careful and cautious

[01:00:00]
and and and and and and what we do I would venture to guess there are probably opportunities that have been presented to us and we say no thank you I'm just not going to do that because I don't want to be unduly influenced I think that happens so and I trust that I that's that's like an affirmative assumption that I have about every single one of us on this board and so for me personally to add it at this point after getting Clarity on that and knowing what it means in terms of the that recusal comes to us at an individual level it's not somebody you know it's not like remember Jackson saying you're going to recuse yourself today it's not that's not how it works it's really about us taking the responsibility for ourselves and for our Behavior so so that's I just want to be really clear on that so what's the language again what I mean it's just to the section on

[01:01:00]
rewrite what are we adding they will disclose it to the board Services office in Pierre board members and recuse themselves correct we could be more specific we can say recuse themselves from votes related to the individual organization Who provided the gift or recuse themselves if there is a real or perceived conflict of interest we can have whatever we want I like the simpler the better with the and recuse themselves I like having if the conditional if there's a perceived for real for real real any other comments on that well I mean the reality is and I think that this has been demonstrated by by members of the sport of in the Press making

[01:02:00]
tons of of allegations of of recusals needs of recusals or conflicts of interest especially when it comes to the negotiated agreement collective bargaining agreements and our employee unions and I I am willing to give Grace to what I may proceed as conflicts of interest when it comes to any number of votes that we've taken but I think there needs to be a level of respect that is not always showing especially when it comes to our collective bargaining or are groups and and I think that's part of the next section so

[01:03:00]
this one is just tied to the gifts so let's let's let's unpack them to that's unpack them separately so get these gifts and I'm sorry I didn't go back to the New Mexico Gift Act so we went through it I think extensively at the last but briefly remind me how so we went so let me read the the language because we struck some out that was that was added in that was not part of the Gift Act so it said board members would adhere to the provisions of the New Mexico Gift Act period if members receive or accept loans or gifts over $250 they will disclose it to the board Services offices in their peer members where we stopped and what we're asking here is just and recuse themselves recuse themselves if if okay if there is a

[01:04:00]
perceived conflict is what you want to add okay I would leave out real or perceived and in simply State a conflict okay so if there is a conflict I like that so board members will recuse themselves if there is a conflict board member Jackson how do you feel about that I think I'm fine with that I guess I'm just I want to remind us all too we just talked about assumptions of what we're trying to do moving forward but I think the clearer we could be the better go ahead I think that is the one thing that I want to add and I'm directly paraphrasing from an email that we got because I thought it highlighted it so well

[01:05:00]
it makes sense for a member to recuse themselves from a vote if their student-centered lens has been focused elsewhere and I think that's what we're trying to do we're trying to make sure that our focus is on the students and that the perception perception is reality right that is that's the truth and if the perception of the public is that we are not focused on the students we are not focused on high ethical standards than that is the reality whether it's true or not that is their reality and also remembering assumptions that you know also remembering that you know our assumption may be incorrect as well so I think what I like about this in the reminder is that it goes back to guard rail number one on us

[01:06:00]
is that this is on us as a board member so nobody is telling you and and you know nobody is saying like I had mentioned it doesn't like board member Jackson doesn't get to come to me tomorrow and say I don't want you to vote on this because of blah blah she could be checking an assumption about me and I could be clarifying that assumption with her because as I had mentioned in my statement if there is something that you perceive or you have concerned about with me just ask me and so I think that's part of it is but this is not to divide us I think I want to make sure on that this is not about dividing us or separating us from the community so that we're leaving the community to believe that we're trying to hide something I don't want that I want it to be that yes we're okay with being transparent there is not difficulty with that that's not the issue

[01:07:00]
but more importantly I think the only way that that can work guys the only way that can work is that if we can live in a lens of also checking our assumptions at the table and also working with the level of integrity and Trust amongst ourselves that's why this governance manual is so important this is more about us than it is about you know the community is watching us the district is watching us absolutely but this has a lot more to say about who we are as a group of of board members and not as individuals follow up on that real quick and what's even more important about that is that the individuals in these chairs are going to change it is absolutely not about me sitting next to you or me sitting next to you it's about the fact that these are going to change and it's the board it's not

[01:08:00]
board member district 7 so it's it is about the board it's not about the individuals and when the new board comes together and they read this governance manual and there are assumptions that are being made hopefully they can come and you guys can speak to each other and not make assumptions about each other and if there is a shift that needs to be made whoever the policy chair is or the board president is willing to listen to that and say I hear these assumptions these are not correct I'm just going to say that's what I did after processing when we left I didn't like these assumptions that were being made and I am trying to get to a point where we can have positive intent moving forward and assumptions that are are based on that

[01:09:00]
that we live from this point of integrity and that we believe in the Integrity of each other so I would actually not have an issue with the language the Courtney had because I think we're just how do we do that and those are real those are real substantive disagreements from an attitude of what's supporting our students and we have to give each other that Grace even though are are outlook of how do we do that can be very substantively different we have to we have to make the assumption that we

[01:10:00]
all are sitting here with the best interest of students in APS in mind inside I don't have a problem with the language that you had because it leaves it it says I mean and having just come back from Council of great City Schools I'll tell you they were many opportunities to take lots of expensive gifts and dinners and drinks from any number of vendors and it was avoid those like the place as the people sitting up here because it's not our job it's not our job when it comes to what deep inside students it becomes a very different conversation so are you offering an amendment or off

[01:11:00]
a gift distract us from our focus on the well-being students oh okay so if there is let's see if the conflict distracts from about and will recuse himself if the gift distracts us from our mission to serve for students I think we're making it more difficult than it needs to be I am I wasn't I was just kind of paraphrase I'm totally fine with it being if there's a conflict because I think because I think from what you just said right the

[01:12:00]
what would be decided internally right that if we're not focused on students if there is this perception I'm worried about adding too much extra to a policy I agree with that I think keeping the language is there is a complex did you see that it was a nice moment we just had I think I think we have some consensus and agreement over here that's great okay all right so let's move from number three cuz the next one is number is it number five board member of the board members are subject to the New Mexico governmental conduct act and will in all instances conduct themselves with the highest professional ethical standards and will not violate federal state or local laws it was number six is number six okay

[01:13:00]
will publicly disclose any campaign contributions okay so each year each board or each year board members will complete the next one OK Google I'm looking at the mock-up document so board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made the contributions and we stopped there so this is the one that was the juicy one as board member Gonzalez would say it's a little bit this is a little bit more a little bit more complex because I believe before we had a dollar amount on this and the way I read it now here is it doesn't matter what kind of paint what campaign contribution at this point there is no dollar amount it's just that we're going to publicly disclose any campaign contribution before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made the contributions

[01:14:00]
and the language that we removed is the the dollar amount but more importantly what we removed is and recuse themselves so this is the one that's a little bit more complex and we did have a conversation that went kind of we kind of sped through it a little bit but this is the one where camping contributions that are made by political action committees are not included because that's the way that the government conduct is written correctly it's because the government that makes the political campaign contribution is different from the entity that the vote is on okay but the sentiment is the same the rationale was not that we talked about as an example donations from

[01:15:00]
committees are packs particularly related to the union and clarified that if you were to get a donation from a pack or from a cope or anything like that that would not qualify as an indicator as a measure for you having to recuse from the vote on for example the collective bargaining agreement because they're different entities okay so so does that clarify for some folks where we are and what we didn't stay in here is just we just didn't add and that clarification in there I mean we didn't state it explicitly but that is what's understood as part of the governmental conduct I'm still you kind of confused me a little bit because you said it doesn't state that there but where does it state it for us it doesn't it was part of the legal counsel's review so there was

[01:16:00]
how would we handle donations from packs and the response from that legal those are different entities so that wouldn't count period they are separate we don't the district does not negotiate with the coke committee the district negotiates with Matthews to me and this is me looking at this from this perspective there is no dollar amount on this now now it's there is no bar so it's any contribution before voting matters involving individual so I feel like the standard is even higher than what we had initially had in there

[01:17:00]
how do folks feel about this one if we just I mean I'm just trying to get a feel for like what would help strengthen this and create more unity and Trust amongst us around this particular statement that I'm just going to ask that flat out so I'm not sure sorry that it was the intention to remove the dollar amount so I think that may have been an error in the edits I think all of the conversation was really around removing the sentence that required refusal but I don't know what the minutes reflector if that's others memories but it did read I don't have it in front of me I did have that 1,000 amount in the individual or Aggregate and then there was the separate component around and will recuse from votes related to individuals or organizations that provide those contributions and what was the rationale for the way that it was written so just help remind me in that at the thousand dollar

[01:18:00]
I can't remember what I was saying specificity so I think there were questions around what amount what qualifies and so that I think in that meeting you know we said well it could be 5000 could be 200 could be 500 let's decide and there seem to be consensus around 1,000 and then we did have a conversation too around the individual or aggregate so sometimes there's contributions that come in multiple over course of times you might get to 5250 500 and so that would count as we wanted to clarify that as well okay and I think just to clarify where that stuff that came from also is that is also mentioned in the New Mexico Gift Act so it again like the continuity of having 25 and 250 and 1,000 are both in the Gift Act and so that's kind of where it came from so if what I what I would say maybe offer as a friendly Amendment excuse me is bored

[01:19:00]
will publicly disclose any campaign contribution in excess of $1,000 before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made that contribution and will recuse themselves if there is a conflict which is exactly what we just said for the 250 board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions in excess of $1,000 in in whether I'm totally blanking

[01:20:00]
weather in individual or in the aggregate thank you weather in individual or in the aggregate before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made the contribution and will recuse themselves if if there is a conflict so describe for me the individual and the aggregate I just I don't want to seem silly so but I I'm kind of blanking on that one so I think so for example there was a union fundraiser for me and this is what I was going to ask I had 1400 come from people who donated $2.50 and $5.10 so the aggregate of that but it's not an individual or an organ but it's it's

[01:21:00]
involving individuals or organizations okay I got that okay so it seems like there are two different things though because those if someone if I write you a check for $5 and another individual right to your check for $5 for your campaign those are coming from the individual if if it's given and that's not let's take James Corporation James does work construction work so if James gave to me $100 this month 100 dollars next month $100 a month after that and it's coming from that we actually would be signing that doing business with and having an actual contract with if you add up all of those and he supposed to dollars I probably should not be

[01:22:00]
voting on the James contract on the RFP that accepts changes the contractor and that's that is much easier to see then the pack that that the developers are the Realtors have where everyone who's a realtor voluntarily writes a check to this organization that's their pack or the cope committee or the the preschool provider pack if there is one whatever it is that those are separate those are separate signing a contract with any of them so it's much easier to see a law firm that gives you so so circling back then with the language and the

[01:23:00]
that was added in there how do you all feel about that what what causes pause if any or does it cause any pause no pause Barbara you're okay that's great this is important so I guess I just need to get clarification because I guess this is been the main example so we're saying with this new policy if a pack or if the union makes a contribution over those aren't counted into this particular policy correct and that's based on the New Mexico it's based on US based on

[01:24:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:25:00]
on the Secretary of State's office list every single time that we get no I agree if we're being if we're being legal reports it records every single time but this just says before voting so obviously before that comes up we would need to cuz we never disclosed that before vote of saying have received this contribution for this amount so now we would do that but it wouldn't but the board member could still vote on the matter is that what we're saying if I if I got 10,000 from McDonald's Corporation I don't know I would have to say before voting I would have to say I received 10,000 dollars from McDonald's Corporation if you're voting on right and will recuse myself if there is a conflict now

[01:26:00]
if there's no conflict because it's the McDonald's pack then there's no conflict and I can still go but I still have to say I received $10,000 from the pack you still have to disclose okay we vote on a CBA well I don't think it's for the purpose even of us but it's just what we're talking about being transparent for the community no one's saying you can't vote like everyone still has that option but it's just making sure we're being transparent but when are

[01:27:00]
when are we all participating in these expressions of transparency on CBA but one else so are we going through lots of different scenarios and what ifs but the main is really around public trust and rebuilding that public trust so I think that's what we need to remember I think like we can continue to provide lots of different examples but like it's going to be hard to know it's always going to change so when would I'm just trying to think of other votes that have come before the board when would

[01:28:00]
board members current board members have to disclose campaign contributions from foundations or from political parties or I guess here's a good considering we have this issue coming up next week we have an issue on Charter Schools see if the charter schools went and gave a donation that was significant we're getting ready to vote on their their contract with us you would need to say that and you need to be able to either more likely recuse yourself you know from that because you received that type of contribution I don't know believe any of us received those but I don't know well what about contributions that are made because I think we're focused on I think we get stuck on is the CBA let's just be real clear because that's where my assumptions are are taking me is that the CDA is what

[01:29:00]
yes she was right here and specifically on the teachers contract let me but I think that's where the assumptions lie because I think there's also important in disclosing contributions that have been made also that might have been anti-union how do those get disclosed and is it also would that be considered matters involving that organization as well because it could also you know be cloudy a perspective there I think I'm just I'm stuck on this whole notion because I really feel like the only thing that we're like that is 0 in on is like the big Target for me is the CBA and and I think that's where we're stuck and I think that's the one that's making us feel divided I first see a time when

[01:30:00]
there would only be members who like me having to disclose and perception in the public is oh well board member Dominguez is always having to disclose her alignment with the unions and nobody else is having to do that and all of a sudden that makes me a Target and perception like you pointed out board member Jackson is is reality and that gets very dangerous and I think a lot of it comes from when we talked about the dollar amount like I think there is this is my opinion there is a significant difference say like if you raise 40,000 and 35,000 came from one group it looks odd it does look like you know if this group did not

[01:31:00]
give you money how would that have changed your campaign or your election it does and I'm just I'm just being very very honest here versus if a group gave you $15 out of your $40,000 and I wish I had raised that much and I guess that's right now because I am a voice for immigrants I am a voice for Working Poor for working professionals but but I don't want to have to be the only one

[01:32:00]
well I don't think all of us will on this phone I think there's a lot more narrowing that could occur and you know board member to go and it's not here but I remember her specifically stating on this one that whole notion of do we start to constrict just you know who's who's able to vote on the board and does it restrict us as a board to be able to really do our work so I think that's all the other issue that problem remind me that there was more to the sentence because there was like unless it interferes with the ability of the board to carry out his duties it says I can

[01:33:00]
and the board agreed or sorry unless the board agrees the recusal will result in an inability to fulfill its legal obligations so that's what was in the original draft we can certainly add that back into whatever Amendment we consider for this evening I think as I said before like there's lots of different scenarios and we don't know what's going to happen with the next board and we don't know what's going to happen with future political contributions for me it's not about the CBA I feel like we resolved that there's the difference between the the political action committee and the actual teachers Federation the negotiate something of the district so for me it is really around the transparency related to other matters so certainly it can be about the CBA for other folks but for me I think like an example would be the example that Barbara provided around the construction company so if I have

[01:34:00]
lots of construction companies giving me $500 $500 $500 and then the vote comes before me I may not be conflicted at all cuz I really don't care about construction but I should say I have received 1500 from this company and therefore I will refuse myself from this phone if if that would lead to an issue with the lack of forum or something then we could discuss that but I think it's not going to happen so frequently that we get ourselves into a position that we're not able to vote and so I think we're all sort of making conjecture about possible what if scenarios which doesn't serve us well except that I heard a difference and I just want to say that because I agree with what you just explained board member Gonzalez I do I agree 100% with what you just said and then board member Jackson I heard something different because you said but if it is the campaign contribution from the pack you do have to disclose it so so that's I think

[01:35:00]
what is getting us hung up like is it so I think and what I worry about is that it's not clearly stated and so what what is what is it that we're actually agreeing to because I agree with the way that you've presented it but I heard something different in the way that board member Jackson described it I'm very comfortable clarifying the language and having read it and what I was responding to was the recusal language specifically because I thought we were in agreement already on the disclosure language I heard something different on the disclosure language I want it clear I think it would be disingenuous to think that they're not board members who

[01:36:00]
saved contributions from packs based on not supporting the CBA and I think that speaks to boards it goes back to we have to assume that all of us with our Myriad of points of view are Myriad of life experiences that there's no one sitting on this board that did not run for their position with the fundamental intention of serving students in APS and how we go about doing that can be different and so I think that speaks to

[01:37:00]
the difference between whatever the pack is and direct contributions from a particular entity so thank you board member Peterson for that and just reminding us that I agree I mean I think we all and as I stated initially come to this with a tremendous amount of Integrity so I think we're just trying to find statement here that is also something that we're all we all have we're all making the same assumption about because I think that I don't think we're still real clear on that in terms of what is being disclosed and and that's the part that I got lost on so board member Jackson and I think board member Gonzales asked you to read what what was the original language is that what we're looking for okay so the original language was

[01:38:00]
all right board members board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions in excess of $1,000 weather in individual or in the aggregate before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made the contribution and will recuse themselves if there is a conflict unless the board agrees the recusal will result in an inability to fulfill its legal obligations any camping contribution

[01:39:00]
board members will publicly disclose any campaign contributions I keep looking at the word any in excess of in excess but any campaign any campaign contribution in excess so when you all hear the word any campaign contribution what does that mean to you is it all of them so so and that would be so let's say the union gave you 2000 and I would say the union gave me 2000 and I will refuse myself if there's a conflict

[01:40:00]
Union didn't and can't because there are also just like their legal definition that was my assistant I don't want to get I don't want to get caught up in a in a Wordsmith here but that was my that was my misstep so if a pack if the if the teachers pack with Coke pack or the communication workers or the police Union made a campaign contribution that was over a thousand dollars and it's before us on their CBA you are stating that we would disclose it and recuse yourself

[01:41:00]
or unless the board agrees that were accused will result in an inability to fulfill its legal obligation so I what I like I know we're not supposed to play this out but here I am like let's play this out this is we're creating all sorts of game plan and gamesmanship for future elections like it's just about we are going to State we are going to State contributions over 100000 if there's a comma and if there's a conflict we will refuse they are two separate issues they are not following issues there's the issue there's the first and if there's a conflict We Will We Will recuse unless it results in an inability to perform our legal obligations and if there's a conflict or if that needs to be stated again the Integrity falls on the board member just to

[01:42:00]
dollars blah blah blah before voting I'm matters if if there is a person if there is a perceived or if there is a conflict I should just do it but it adds the same language that we had it to the Gift Act at the top that's before matters related to that individual organization if there is a conflict so are we are we excluding packs that's what I'm not clear about yes

[01:43:00]
because there is no conflict because it's a different organization okay that's not what that says right again it's the board member who is going to be responsible for deciding that any campaign yes and recusing or stating it or saying I have a conflict but that again it doesn't mean I'll pick up Romero doesn't get to say to me you must you must refrain from voting cannot do that because it is up to the individual and their integrity and I will just say this so as for president if a conflict comes in that there's you know somebody complaining about a conflict then that conflict has to be resolved by the board president

[01:44:00]
turn on the individual could happen I will just say I think by stating that this will be done and if we are holding ourselves to that level I'm I'm a person of Integrity I'm you know I will disclose if I need to but if there is no reason for me to I won't so because there's no conflict is the very next section of the government's manual where it talks about if there are board member concerns that's where that that is all written out as to how the board president will address those those concerns so future boards don't have the benefit of this conversation all the details going into this and so I'm looking at this strictly as the words that I see

[01:45:00]
for me board members will publicly disclose any I mean any campaign contributions outside of packs before voting on I mean I think you have to be more there's a Clarity here because a board members will in the future will come and look at that and say you have to disclose is related to individuals or I don't have any more related to individuals or organizations Who provided that contribution there is that specific language and it was cold from the sog scoring rubric so I was just going to try to pull that up but there is there was that specific language in the original draft and so I'll try to get it and I want to just say to this assumption on that board member Dominguez

[01:46:00]
because the new board members coming in I want to be really thoughtful about new board members you know cuz there are going to be at least two at least two new board members that are coming in and taking into account the the piece of how difficult it was for the orientation around the shift that we had with this transition the last couple of years I would hope that what will occur because I know I'm going to be part of this I'm going to help on this part is with the orientation with new board members coming in is to provide that Clarity and to provide that support to help them understand these pieces and what I'm going to assume is that the board members that are here are also going to be assisting these new board members to also help them understand this piece and help them around interpretation as they're coming in through

[01:47:00]
it's not going to be perfect at all at all and there may be concerns on one particular member fills that another member should have disclosed and whoever is board president is going to be the one that's going to have to deal with that because that's that's how that's going to all play out I'm hoping that it doesn't because what I'm hoping that this document does more of than create that division is to create a sense of like how we just operate ourselves and that there's going to be as board member Peterson was talking about this whole notion of just giving Grace there has to be a period of Grace on this and not this constant it can't be seen as division because remember what happens in the boardroom happens in the classroom and if this board is continually seen as at odds at that it's like one side versus the other that's

[01:48:00]
it's not going to be helpful for anybody it's not helpful for our relationship with the Union just not helpful it's not helpful for our parents and it's certainly not helpful for our students so I think just having this Clarity having some agreement on this but also making a commitment to check our assumptions and also to check for integrity and just helping I think the most important part that we can do is a team is also support each other to build our integrity and not beat us down that you don't have integrity because that's the worst thing that could happen it's a team of eight which includes the superintendent and if it's not working in that way then it's not it's not useful and I don't think we will get to the outcomes that we need to get to so I don't have I just want to say I don't have any difficulty with the way that the language is is stated with the clarification that

[01:49:00]
board member Gonzalez made around I mean that understanding because four of you are definitely going to know that you made that statement that it does not include the past and that's on your integrity on that I just wanted to provide the language from the sosg evaluation so it's under unity and trust and it's in order to meet student outcomes focus it says the board has included language and its ethics and this is where we got it from the language and it's ethics and conflict of interest statement requiring the board members fully recuse themselves from matters involving individuals or organizations who made campaign contributions to them or who appointed them and so if you recall we took the

[01:50:00]
who appointed them because it wasn't particularly relevant and it was confusing and then we added $1,000 dollar amount we added the individual or aggregate point but the key thing here is Will publicly disclose any campaign contribution over 1,000 whether individual or aggregate when voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made contributions to them that's the period and then the subsequent sentences and will recuse themselves of conflict of interest interferes with their ability it will refuse themselves and then that piece that Courtney had around unless it unless it interferes with their ability to fulfill legal obligations got changed to business entities it doesn't

[01:51:00]
me personally I don't know how that distinguishes it I mean I don't actually bring up in her explanation and I don't know if this was I don't know if this is to the group or just to me but when she wrote that she mentions were the problem in Texas and and so I asked I don't remember why I was sure I mean b explicit so one of the things that I know about New Mexico and I know about our let's just say

[01:52:00]
play APS is a hole as a public entity one of the things that's so great about some of our procurement processes for the state and the procurement laws is that it's very tight so we don't have similar issues that other states are having where there is it is kind of a willy-nilly and those things kind of a curse so for us that's not what's happening at all I mean even rfps that come to us for like Capital Improvement there's a blind committee that's looking at that they score it they all stuff in the only thing we're looking at is a recommendation that they made that we had no part in so we didn't influence who was selected or how they were selected or how they were scored so so that part I'm not worried about that I mean I think and we kind of were able to put that to rest I guess I'm just I'm struggling with this one I hear the struggle because I hear that there's some fear

[01:53:00]
board member Dominguez in terms of the way that this is stated that is leaving you a little bit uncertain am I correct is it uncertain or a little fearful yeah I think we can play on to our integrity I don't have the benefit of that you're right you're right and I'm keenly I mean what is still with me is history I'm

[01:54:00]
only aware of August 2023 or first the the Uproar over the CBA and and there was a very much a union anti-union rhetoric going on and that informs my discomfort right now and and and and and to that point I don't think there has been a move to ameliorate in any way that very public Rift with our Workforce and it's a Workforce that we absolutely need and and again I don't want to be the only

[01:55:00]
well I know now that this I can say number six does not apply to Pacs I know that but when I first came on board I didn't know that this is all new and I'm thinking ahead to to people who are new to this experience who will not are navigating new Waters because they're not Political Animals they're common everyday citizens who rise to the occasion to do the job and so that's the lens I'm looking at all of this the wording so yes when I was so if you could make this friendlier or to help a layer fear is what would you add

[01:56:00]
and it does not include I would be I would be explicit about Paces yeah I would be explicit about that board member Gonzalez were you going to say something that would never come before us and so it's really more around the education then for board members to understand that that's not when it's going to be required right and again as you mentioned we're doing an orientation for the new board members they will be oriented too part of the conversation can be I'd like to point your attention to number six

[01:57:00]
we had a robust deliberation about this and I want to clarify for you because one of the points that we discussed was the difference between a pack and a union or that would negotiate with the district and because donations come from the pack and not the union that's an example of something that would not apply however a donation from a Textbook Company would apply because we do vote on this okay so that takes care of one yeah and and that would be part of that part of onboarding yes okay there's there's still the history of it right but yeah I'm just going to I'm just going to leave it at that I am I'm leaning toward

[01:58:00]
being okay with this but there I just want to make it very clear that we have work to do as a board with a significant part of our Workforce and just when we get to the CBA next time around I hope that that is not part of this I mean that it doesn't become part of this this doesn't become an issue in that conversation okay support member Gonzalez leading towards a yes on this knowing that we're going to have this comprehensive orientation we've got to commitment from board member Gonzalez

[01:59:00]
we've just heard it said that that's how this orientation would take place in the conversation would occur we've got a board Services office here so that's going to be dually noted board member Topia Romero how do you feel about that at this point I feel I feel good about it I'll leave my personal comments alone but I feel good about it okay board member Jackson I agree with that I feel very good about it and I think it is something that needs to be done to make Common Sense Provisions to maintain public trust or member Peterson I can live with it I think we live in a contentious time does get taken out of context

[02:00:00]
and so I I continue to have concerns that it can be misrepresented and the individual board members can be called out and shamed in some way and it comes down to the Integrity of the board and that's regardless of whoever is sitting here this is going forward but with the clarifications so we had some other so those were the two areas that I wanted to come back on because and and I just want to say I'm grateful to hear that

[02:01:00]
because I think that it it it it it it it embodies the willingness to be a collective and that's that's what's critical in this it's not easy to get to consensus everybody's making some you know is making some concessions at this point or putting their fears behind or and letting their assumptions go that's a hard thing to do and so I I just want to say you guys are making me cry because I think that's what we work for and that's the important part that we're showing out to the community that there's that willingness to do that we have compromised on so many things a lot this whole year and I think it just demonstrates the growth you know that this board has gone through and and the pieces that were willing to have hard conversations about and it's important and I'm glad that we took the time to do this because I think I did not want to see the community to see

[02:02:00]
in this way of being at odds with this on this because I don't think that's where we were at all we were just we just didn't have an opportunity to really unpack it and really clarify where we were so the whole document was presented I know that our wonderful analysts made a bunch of changes and all the board members had a chance to look at that did we capture all of the changes appropriately and accurately I'm going to I'm going to defer to board member Gonzalez and since this was the document that you had presented as part of policy well I mean actually it was the document from the ad hoc committee on governance which was a member Jackson of the opportunity to answer the question since I have I do think that they captured all of the edits there was one thing that we did not get to in the meeting

[02:03:00]
had provided with us which was a proposed additional section to the governance manual and if you recall we had when we did our self-evaluation there was a component in the unity and Trust section that said the board has passed a policy in their governance manual which requires the superintendent to provide if the superintendent has provided information to one board member they shall provide it to all board members so bored Services prepared language for that and then in the course of the policy committee meeting I just completely forgot about it because we spent so much time on this other stuff and so what I had what I'd like to propose is that rather than adding a whole new section we just added a sentence under 3B which is superintendents responsibilities are sorry superintendent role so if you look at section 3B there's five things that are there for superintendent role I would propose that we had number six

[02:04:00]
switch just reads information provided by the superintendent to one board member is provided to all board members and that would allow us to get that one point on the sofa evaluation but it was also another oversight from the policy committee meeting that falls on page 7 right page 7 so it's just going to be the six bullet point okay so I'm sorry I didn't mean to overlook the ad hoc folks did we capture all of your revisions rather than using if the conditional making a more forceful picture from my timer at this in another

[02:05:00]
mobilizes around a clear plan yada yada yada yada yada yada and when APS cultivate and when APS establishes clear distinct systems then Albuquerque Public Schools will improve student outcomes how to spell about that okay Barbara okay I think we've got that all right anything else for remember I'm going to go ahead and mention that was there was a document that got

[02:06:00]
we lost it we didn't include it and it's on board Communications we came up with this back with Brenda Yeager it was it was a list and Johanna King had the document I'm just wondering if how people would feel about it was we agreed to it it was that one of our first meetings in agreement between us about how we would communicate like it was the one that said no surprises

[02:07:00]
a facilitator at that meeting that we created with e&s Cabela at our first Retreat and we did bring that to Ashley as part of this process as well and she said that didn't really apply for this governance manual which is why I was not included because it seems to me and I you know I I don't know if I have the lifeline with Ashley out there she's probably listening to us but I would assume that board Norms would and this is an assumption I'm making but it seems when the new board comes on to is like really checking those norms and coming back together and circling around those pieces I don't know I mean that's what I would think if I was leading a team again I mean that's what I would do but um because the board Norms could shift out it was not sorry

[02:08:00]
governance manual so she suggested you could certainly write Norms related to how you interact with each other how you communicate with each other but that's different from policy you don't policy you don't write policy around behaviors and it seems to me like again like that would be something that is the new board comes together having that Retreat together sort of refreshing all of that and coming to Center as a team on that okay anything else for that I'm sorry I didn't mean to like the does that does that meet your needs their I think so although scrolling here is it possible to

[02:09:00]
you have a policy around cell phone usage we had it in there when did it get taken out in the original didn't say a no phone usage during meetings I thought that was similarly Ashley's points around we can't we shouldn't write policy around individual Behavior okay well I would say it wasn't in a policy it might have been somewhere in a procedural okay okay to check ourselves on that too because texting during a board meeting could be perceived as getting information in your phones could be so it's very important because it could be the perception that there was a conversation that was taking place with somebody else in your phones or subject to an emperor I got that just from an attorney the other day so

[02:10:00]
just be careful with that so if it was not part of this and she didn't say we could legislate we don't we can't put that in a policy that's fine okay that's it the only thing that I had and this is coming from the meeting at the sosg meeting on the cascading of responsibilities and I'm trying to find my page where I put this in but on the cascading of responsibilities that are cascaded down from the board down to the superintendent one of the things that they recommended very specifically was that cascading responsibility to the superintendent to actually prepare a budget that needs to be presented to and I think we have that we review it but the the superintendent is responsible for preparing that budget in accordance with like state laws and regulations and then

[02:11:00]
resetting it to the board for review and approval and in ours it's got to be reviewed and approved against our goals and our guard rails so that was the only one that I I left away from the sosg meeting just remembered that cuz that one was specifically called out in the delegation policies yeah and the delegation and help me I thought I had a yeah I think I had it in here it is delegation policies in the superintendent's but you know I'm trying to get my comment and it won't come up so and I think that's where I put it in the superintendent's role is just we say preparing recommendations for policies to be adopted but in accordance with laws and regulations in the superintendent will be responsible for preparing a budget

[02:12:00]
and then present you know that because they are the ones that he is the one he or she is the one that's responsible for sort of like following all those rules and processes and preparing that budget and we review it we're not we're not abdicating our responsibility for the budget but we're cascading it down to the superintendent to actually do the work and I think for transparency purposes for the community to understand is that we don't prepare the budget ourselves we review it but they're superintendent is responsible for preparing it so we would go ahead board member Gonzalez so it's on page 7 under 3D number two would become in accordance with laws and regulations the superintendent will be responsible for preparing an annual budget and recommendations for policies to be adopted by the board comma blah blah blah okay perfect I just wanted to add that

[02:13:00]
I walked away with and I think that was the only substantive change that I had on the manual for temperature good okay so our wonderful analyst Jessica we added so I think all of the other changes then the the edits the lines everything that we did in there you're good with and I believe the board is fine we'll probably just see it in one final form go ahead and do have a question regarding page 11 with the recusal were

[02:14:00]
wanting to add in the language of unless the Board of Education decides that recusal will prevent aboard the board from fulfilling its right that was my only question okay all right great work ladies I just want to say great work cuz this was hard work and I appreciate everybody I know it's taken us a little longer than we thought you all probably saw this agenda here early but know this was important all right so I will consider emotions for approval of the Board of Education governance manual I'd like to make motion for approval of the Board of Education

[02:15:00]
report from the superintendent thank you I'm president members of the board I'm happy to be with you tonight it's been interesting to listen to you all for the last 2 hours I just have I know it would be at the end of a long meeting so I just have two items to highlight although the district continues to be incredibly busy right now is as we shift from Halloween to Thanksgiving in a moment of silence for those teachers that have to teach today after Halloween there's two days in the public school calendar that teachers dread one is Halloween the other is guests

[02:16:00]
the other Valentine's Day Valentine's Day test The hormone-driven Angst Valentine's Day plus candy it's just two items to highlight as we enter so first graduation rates I've done a couple interviews recently and I just wanted to provide an update on our graduation rates and shed some light on the challenges we face during the virtual learning phase the pandemic I need to remind people that these rates are two years old and so this is the first year that we had come back and as anticipated we observed a decline in our graduation rates a phenomenon we've been added by using the board to expect last few years later returned to face to face instructions there's a multifaceted reasons behind this Decline and then we can articulate and others that remain a little unclear so during the virtual learning phase of the pandemic we encountered a significant

[02:17:00]
cost of approximately 5,000 students many of these students transition to homeschooling private schools or relocated out of the state and additionally some students seemingly vanished aligning with the national Narrative of the Lost Children of the pandemic it's essential to note that students Who provided information about their new academic Endeavors should have been removed from our roles however the State's graduation rate calculation allowing each student four years to graduate means that unrecorded transitions affect our overall rate this includes students of obtaining a GED or graduating in the subsequent semester connectivity challenges the need for employment to mitigate family income loss and health and mental health issues significantly impacted students during the pandemic the graduation rate reflects those who fell behind as well as those who graduated later or in an alternative setting it's noteworthy that the state did not make adjustments to the formula during these

[02:18:00]
unprecedented times looking ahead we anticipated period of relatively stagnant graduation rates before witnessing an upward Trend as new quartz unaffected by credit loss during the pandemic entered the system the successful implementation of the Strategic plan is expected to play a pivotal role in this trajectory to address the challenges and most of our graduation rates we must remain committed to expanding Career and Technical education programs sustaining clubs and activities and ensuring rigorous instruction that engages our students are attendance teams will persist in their efforts to enhance School attendance recognizing that there's no singular solution to restoring our graduation rates however the existing structures have set us on the right path and it's imperative that we stay the course of course your continued support and dedication to our shared objects or instrumental in overcoming these challenges and ensuring success of our students along those lines today

[02:19:00]
excellent results released you may recall that we were expecting those assessment results in June I think so here we are and I think this is the norm Sol Elementary and Middle School students in Albuquerque Public Schools perform better on this year's student assessments with the largest gains in English language arts and smaller gains in mathematics and science APS 11th graders meanwhile saw a decline from the prior school year in mathematics science and evidence-based reading and writing according to assessment results released today by the state public education department these results show the 4.6 percent increase in English language arts for elementary middle school students with 39.6 of students who took the test last Spring Texas compared to 35% of the prior year a half percentage increase in mathematics for elementary middle school students with 25.67 1.2%

[02:20:00]
Improvement in science district-wide with 34.9 % proficient compared to 33.753% drop in science with 38.1% compared to 42% of the previous year and then there's a percentage Point drop in evidence-based reading and writing for high school juniors which is pretty negligible 3.7 % Point drop in mathematics for high schoolers with 18.3 percent proficient compared to 22% the previous year so the proficiency rates are based on two tests New Mexico students in the spring of 2023 measures of Student Success in a students in grades three through eight with the science test all the High School junior high school juniors in mathematics and reading and writing were based on the SAT score day great example of course the district is launched several initiatives aimed at improving academic outcomes for all students

[02:21:00]
they include and we always start with this the shift to student outcomes Focus governance by the Board of Education adoption of a new strategic plan for the district that among other things requires that students are being taught at grade level with high quality materials and that principles are supporting the work the plan also prioritizes student engagement and doing anything possible to ensure APS schools are safe and that students feel welcome and challenged and administration of your organization that places greater emphasis on improving literacy and Mathematics proficiency rates specifically One Associates departments to improve literacy rates while another associate superintendent is in charge of the district's efforts to improve math proficiency rates increased instructional time in English and Mathematics for elementary school students and free online tutoring for all students with APS began offering last spring so where I'm excited to see the improvements I recognize that this is just one

[02:22:00]
that does not make a trend just like we had a hard time setting our growth models when we had one year of data okay we have two years it's good we can start projecting growth but we'll see what happens next year but it's good you know I think if nothing else standing Pat is not falling behind and again we are still dealing with the effects the pandemic but we are making some progress and I'd like to say that I'm glad that the reading scores were not I hope it says something about the focus on letters I would love to see more growth but I hope people are encouraged and feel like okay we can really start turning this move this bus move this busy it's not going to be simple but we'll continue in a positive path with that and the superintendent's report thank you or can we move on

[02:23:00]
thank you so much for for all of that information I know it was like an interesting day it's like it's a little confusing between the the two systems and having the assessments and so I would imagine for the community it's a little bit confusing Vista says one thing and then we've got this other so there's a lot of work that needs to be done around here we clarify these things it's an interesting point because if you looked at Vistas yesterday so you know there is a continuing Evolution and as they work in their new student information system I think you're going to see some struggles but we are doing a good job of looking today Mr West and his team are being very Vigilant and review very carefully and making sure they can replicate the results that the state is producing period

[02:24:00]
across the board so everyone can see our actual got the numbers today some things that are going on behind the scenes that we have to resolve before we jump into that but it shouldn't take us very well I know that they were still kind of messing with some data and just making sure that we're real clear on on what what it is we're reporting there because there is a little bit I'm confused as a community in the right direction of of teachers and Educators in this building and its I mean we might set the tone and we can adopt policy

[02:25:00]
the building level folks that make it happen absolutely great great point I know everybody's working hard so much work all right my next item is just the president's report I'm going to be really brief and quick cuz I think we want to get out of here so as you heard earlier tonight the search for the Albuquerque Public schools superintendent is in full swing there is a web page that has gone up so that was sent out to the board members and it's made public so there's going to be a lot of transparency on that and invite our community members to take a look that will be adding information as we go there the community engagement committee thank you for playing the two events and we're working with sapper right now with the Strategic analysis and program research to put together the online survey that survey is I think they were going to finish it up by today did they get it to us we don't know for sure not yet

[02:26:00]
anyway I'm not going to put somebody in there but it's it's here real soon either tomorrow for sure or the next I mean really quickly that survey just so that the board members know I have asked the community engagement committee to be the ones that take a look at that for that last language piece there was a lot of work that went into that and what we're doing is we're going to be doing the survey in house instead of doing it with the K-12 group that Mac and Jay was recommending we can actually do a whole lot more internally and so there was work with Communications and with the supper team and Joanna was part of that conversation there was a lot of work going on there so the survey is I understand is just about complete and so it's not going to come to the full board for review and final wordsmithing will be here forever so I am going to trust the ad hoc committee the community engagement committee to take a look at that

[02:27:00]
and you know just just do your best on that taking into account the fox and you know every of everybody on the on this team and so we'll get that done but the survey we plan to share that with the public beginning November 8th and it's going to run from November 8th to the 22nd I want to encourage students families staff and Community complete the survey and the board will use the public input as we evaluate the applicants and just like the goals and guard rails we want the characteristics of the new superintendent to reflect the community's visions and values the superintendent job is now posted so you can find the link to the application on the aps superintendent search website as well feel free to share the link and the deadline to apply is December 12th we are on track to having a new superintendent hopefully selected by the end of January and place to hit the ground when superintendent Elder begins his retirement which is actually July 1st and everybody he's still here with us and he's going to continue to be here with us

[02:28:00]
doing all this hard work for this next semester so I just want to say how much I appreciate superintendent and the work that he's doing right now to keep everything going lastly I just want to say that board member Peterson and I had a chance to attend the fall 2023 tribal leaders Summit was a wonderful Summit our tribal leaders were there in just a shout out again to the district I think for engaging with that Community a really important conversation around the needs assessment that is currently underway I can have I'll have Johanna maybe we can collect the the presentation material this one and and share it with the board members it was really a good framework that they're using for assessing the needs of our students there's going to be a draft document this coming out this is going to be going to the tribal leaders themselves to make sure that we're capturing their their needs and and that it's

[02:29:00]
reflective of what their what they're wanting to see in that and so I think that will also help inform us around some of the characteristics in the needs that we need around a superintendent to it's very reflective of that it's their Community voice and then I just want to encourage our board members there's a really this is this is Native American Indian American awareness month and so there is going to be a pow wow that's going to be held at Albuquerque High on the night and I went last year it's just a wonderful event if you can get there I highly recommend it it's this is our youth and our leadership team from APS just encourage you to to get out there and kind of listening and learn with our community and with that

[02:30:00]
I would encourage you all to vote on November 7th especially in the middle of the election just a reminder that we have no Levy election results and encourage people to vote there is wonderful information on social media please share it with your social media so we can get that we can get people encouraged to vote for that so all right next Board of Education meeting will be November 15th I can't believe we're in November 2023 at 5 p.m. and the special Board of Education meeting on Charter Schools will be November 8th at 5 p.m. meeting will be held here at the Allison Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live streaming aps.com edu and again I just want to say thank you so much the board tonight for your hard work and first coming to consensus that was awesome thank you

[02:31:00]
stop talking
