Ronaldo Tom burrito yes Heather benavidez yes Josefina Dominguez yes next on the agenda is public forum comments limited to agenda items comma so I'll be limited to the matters listed on this agendas on this meeting's agenda please Welcome to our country we have anyone thank you I apologize we did not have any sign up for public forum this morning okay then I am going to skip over all of that and we're going to move on to item number five discussion items to be considered for committee approval our next item to be considered for approval and perhaps discussion is the August 20th or function transfers for Grant bud

[00:03:00]
it's a discussion so all right well and now it's also an approval so I do I need a no we just discussed agenda for the next meeting is there any discussion regarding the internet for Grant Budget Rental on the meeting to discuss this item okay I'm going to get back to the agenda because

[00:04:00]
do you have questions but at this moment the questions are mostly about where in this agenda is it appropriate to discussion questions that we were not aware of previously I was not aware of previously and I had no idea that the state has purchased it for 6:30 so I wanted to ask at our purchasing for that new status

[00:05:00]
well it's I don't know I'm asking where would be the appropriate place in the agenda to ask those questions OK Google

[00:06:00]
and I think I remember a lengthy discussion about that under the RFI policy thank you so if there are no there's no discussion for this item I have a quick question a board member to me okay this is an expenditure when did it happen if anybody on the call can answer that question and maybe it's in one of the reports that we're going to review and if that's the case then I think that that's appropriate for it to be discussed yes or whatever Josefina is referring to in terms of I mean when did when was the expenditure in this finance committee meeting

[00:07:00]
okay well we'll have to look into that okay to see when it was made okay so then we will just get back to the agenda if that's okay with everyone board member tell Mauricio are you good with moving on yes I am okay the second item is consideration of approval of the August 2025 in traffic

[00:08:00]
for the month of August 2025 they include the reversion of the title funding due to the federal unfreeze remember that there is a time delay in that out of the holding accounts aligning for the priority School positions in Medicaid and alignments to approve the applications budget and program needs and for that I stand for questions so one quick question are how do we know that we are what can you tell us about the spend down are we are we spending down our grant or grant money

[00:09:00]
on time in a timely manner we monitor the spending and percent of spending on a quarterly basis and I'm not sure if doctor is on this call but I know that she has implemented a quarterly update for all programs and schools on where they are with their spending how they can how the district can support them to be more efficient to understanding so we can use this year's funds on this year's students and I believe I just notice for any additional details yes phone number

[00:10:00]
play some bedtime music the first one is next month with the freeze and unfreeze of some of the federal funds that kind of put us back a little bit but the goal is that we remain on target especially with Oracle coming on board we really do have a lot of hard deadlines that we need to meet and so we are working with schools and departments to make sure they have the tools needed to see where they're spend down is and in particular could you tell us where we stand with the grant that the youngest presented about at our last board meeting I believe he had worked to get get a grant so that we could expand PSAT test taking opportunities any updates on that committee Dominguez committee members of the committee superintendent Blakey not at this time that is something we can get you at a later date

[00:11:00]
okay because I know PSAT is right around the corner right isn't it October when I don't expect you to know that as a former teacher I know that it's yes Heaven thank you chair Dominguez that's not a grant it was an appropriation and I believe it's about 2 million dollars as far as I know because I read the memo yesterday from peed and the districts were supposed to and I can see Daniel has his hand up and he could probably correct me he has a deeper understanding but as far as I understood the schools were supposed to order the tests and then ped would pay the cost of the tests for all the students and that money wasn't necessarily coming to the district but Daniel please correct my understanding good morning chair Dominguez thank you guys superintendent

[00:12:00]
thank you board member Benavides for bringing this to our attention and the student who was looking into this we did some research and we were able to find that yes indeed it was an appropriation and it was passed a few years ago and it is with the public education department and so what we're doing with our government Affairs department is we're tracking there's a we have a growing list of items that are with ped that have not been dispersed to our district and so we're adding to this to the list and we'll be researching this in the coming weeks and we'll get back to you as I think this is an important item for us to track if I understand correctly with legislative

[00:13:00]
to investigate what's happened to these monies yeah where the good thing is the public education department has been very open and communicative and so in tracking down we just need a recruiting this running list of different funds that were waiting for disbursement on and we're adding this to the list and I'll be in touch with them find out the status of the process and report back okay so all Appropriations go through ped that's correct their the Fiscal Agent for anything that's kind of below the line funding so it gets to them and then we get to that is that correct Draya

[00:14:00]
I just want to give a quick shout out to the student to brought this to my attention and who worked so hard on it I believe his name is Walter Bradford and I'm hoping I'm not getting his first name wrong I took it down really quickly at an event but he's a very bright young man and his initiative that he took to to work with legislators to do this is really really commendable and impressive and so thank you mister Bradford and good luck in your future endeavors if you're listening will send him a clip okay so any any more discussion on the item it's not say nothing we're going to move on to item 5.3 consider approval of August 2025 inter function transfers

[00:33:00]
when did a war to Harrison Contracting Company utilizing RFP decided RFP that was part of the required procurement method the estimated purchase is for 3 years at $750,000 using operational Federal and capital funds and I think it's key to know that this is as needed for installation of different flooring including carpet tile Napoleon Etc stand for your questions then here thank you I have none either and of course I do period where they have

[00:34:00]
slick floors in their gyms so is this not that we have the money to remodel that kind of floor but would that be included in this kind of does this particular vendor have that kind of expertise that I'm sure I'm joined by John dufay or assistant Deputy of operations that can answer that question Mr duvet Madame this contract does not include that that is a specialty gym flooring is there's two different types of vinyl floor tile for middle school and or wood and we also use a call this contract does not include this those are

[00:35:00]
specialty items by a few contractors and vendors who can do that type of work period that equals or exceeds 500,000 for Floor Covering sales only drunkenness yes thank you madam chair members of the committee Dr Blakey unlike the previous item this is for the purchase of these materials they did go through the required procurement process we are recommending a multi-award use the utilizing the RFP the estimated purchases for 8 years

[00:36:00]
at 2.4 million using operational Federal and capital funds we stand for questions and seek your approval hey let me get to that scroll down and see what my notes say and in the meantime fellow board members do you have any questions no questions I do have a question we have several vendors here but we only had Harrison Contracting on the previous on the previous bid for lack of a better word or so can you explain that I'm sure

[00:37:00]
we do advertise our beds in the rfps we also use a system called vendor registry where we are notify vendors that have registered and we look at our previous contracts to make sure that we notify our incumbents so we do get the word out as far as why only some of the other ones did not have the labor the power to be able to support a contract perhaps they could have dropped the ball in are department and didn't submit so without really going out to each one of them to ask him how come they didn't submit we make sure that we advertise it notify them email them call them

[00:38:00]
to let them know if the opportunity so I don't know if John has any other Insight yes Madam chair and Dr Blakey the issues what happens with a lot of the event we we have vendors or suppliers that will supply many different products that are directly from the factory and of course then we need to have the installers that's why they're separate what happens with the installation and installers is that there are requirements that they have to meet for a meeting that we have such as what we need to do a classroom or something we can't do it during the day in in disruptive learning time in the classroom so what requirements are they have to work evenings or they have to do weekend installations and that's the lead on most of those that we

[00:39:00]
require the other issue is that they don't have the Manpower lifetimes to do full wings that we require them to do or again this special requirements where we have to remove the old tile and do asbestos removal if the tiles there then they have to be able to put the carpet on and most of these companies don't have the ability to do this like the one that we it's has that ability and also the ability to do all different brands of carpet installation non-slip any of those types they can do those all and many of them specialize in just one and that is one reason why

[00:40:00]
we only get a few bids on those thank you for that explanation any comments or questions further questions and see none we're going to move on to item 5114 for this expenditure stand ready to answer any questions you may have and secure approval I am joined by Mr dufay who has background in the area who may

[00:41:00]
able to assist with questions but in layman terms this expenditure basically facilitates new construction maintenance of current landscaping and support in those Associated areas fellow board members any any questions observations and then for me thank you I'm just going to voicemail about having only one one vendor and and I understand about our size and what not but I do think you know I didn't major in economics but I do know that the power of competition Drive some cost down when you only have one

[00:42:00]
in these moments where we have to think of our budget budget costs yeah and just an observation that maybe we can think out of the box and and Spread spread the wealth in our community and and the talent but I know that's easier said than done one of the things that I would say in response to that is a general one of the things that is complicated about some of these requests is that it's not at 8:25 kind of request or contractors to come in during off hours to do some of this work as to ensure that we're maintaining the Integrity of instructional time with noise Interruption Etc and that does pose a challenge or Nuance to our partners

[00:43:00]
considering their ability to seek or apply for these jobs if you will so that's something that is very much at the Forefront in terms of our responsibility making sure that we support our instructional space consider approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 500,000 for backflow products and supplies and Dr Gonzalez Madam chair members of the committee Dr Blakey thank you we are seeking your consideration of approval for this request it is a multi-year ward you realizing the side of bid and procurement method the estimated purchase for

[00:44:00]
yours is at 1.6 million using operational Federal and capital funds this request basically facilitates making sure that we are safeguarding our drinking water is preventing outside non-potable water from entering our domestic water system where we have several different Water Systems interacting with one another irrigation sprinkler systems Etc and really making sure that we are keeping drinking water clean and healthy for our students and stuff for your questions and secure approval and letting you know I'm scrolling and so you all have disappeared from my screen no questions here but glad we're doing that yes indeed Ronaldo do you have any comments questions

[00:45:00]
thank you yes indeed can you tell me which of these I know that when Supply I'm familiar with when Supply because they took over a local company that I was working with in or supporting in Las Cruces many years ago and I and maybe they did the same here so which of these is a local small company any Madame there's a number of local offices some of them are like States and in the number of the vendors that are the regionally bigger companies they're not

[00:46:00]
play Southwest the mountain region stuff like that so they have four or five places that were able to utilize their warehouses and utilize the product they have and get it here if it's not so those are really nice to have that are bigger but they're not Nationwide so much more Regional than they are nationwide their original thank you thank you 1 3 3

[00:47:00]
well I'm excited to tell you madam chair members of the committee Dr Blakey that we are here for your consideration of approval for this expenditure that does exceed $500,000 for that dance technique instruction we have gone through the procurement process required we are seeking a multi-award utilizing the sided RFP and procurement method for a purchase of 6 years at 1.2 million using Grant and operational funds basically what this will enable us to do is contract with some of our local dance studios to enhance the Arts in our schools and we stand for questions and secure approval board member any questions I do not but I think that's a great

[00:48:00]
this is fantastic and super excited about it thank you for presenting I love that is on there and and of course I've been to the National Institute the dance Institute and and I'm so impressed with the kids that they that they bring into the fold their typically not the kids you would think would be dancers but I love that they redefine what a dancer can be so appreciate this but a final question what is this is this for has to be not for the instruction but for a facility use of a facility

[00:49:00]
I'm just trying to get a clear understanding of Madam chair members of the committee Dr Blakey it will be for the instruction on the Contracting with these vendors to facilitate their expertise in the specialty area as you mentioned one example is by Labyrinth by cortical several schools middle and high school even Elementary School contract with them to support that instruction and we do facilitate via facilitron based on the school's needs before or after school support or in some cases during the school day it's just dumped dependent on the school schedule and how they are interacting with the sided vendors for their okay for some reason I was just in capital mode because of everything that we come before but thank you know this is a great

[00:50:00]
thank you for that clarification moving on or to item wait a minute where are we oh five point 14 consider approval of August 2025 cash disbursements and I think I do have a question somewhere but I'm going to allow myself

[00:51:00]
could we get a report on on what modrall Sperling was was helping out with we were Consulting with them and I noticed Walsh Gallegos is Kyle Robinson the specific lawyer that helped the and I'm assuming all of this is district and my second question is what is the is there a board cost here I didn't want to bring to your attention something that had been asking for and we did put in a summary table and we also put a graph

[00:52:00]
that we will continue to use this fiscal year so you can see the different expense types and then we have the July and the August we did add our payroll numbers because those are big numbers that we want to make sure that the board members in the community are aware of and we do have a listing by expense categories and each individual of voucher or check that was written as far as getting into the details of each check that would require more research to be able to answer those so I don't know if that would go through the R5 process of yes I believe so in the same can put together how many of those are administrative and bored

[00:53:00]
so legal reasons for legal expenses and board versus administrative okay thank you and and this is a good start right the the disbursement Trends and let's see but I do have questions about the contract Services we see a 7 million

[00:54:00]
and the actual detail listing if you look at the details and we do have the expense type there so you would be able to align it and look for Contract Services and you would be able to see the different vendors and the different amounts that go with it in the detail listing it ties back to those categories it just seems like the grass doesn't capture the the level of expense right we can double check that graph and make sure that it's displaying accordingly well I mean it's the graph shows the first Mark is 10 million is that correct

[00:55:00]
reason for the graph that is difficult is because our payroll is so large compared to all of the other items that if we were to put it in larger increments it would get worse if we put it in smaller increments it will be really hard to read so that's why the table is there the only way to really kind of do that is to Take payroll off of the graph but then you're missing where the majority of the money is going it's because of the discrepancy in how much payroll is to the next largest expenditure yes yes correct I mean I understand this this is a an Aggregate and like I said I appreciate this first first time introduction of graph I guess I would like to see a more

[00:56:00]
I'd like to see a disaggregated graph for Contract Services by vendor because that is a concern of mine you know one one particular vendor is well represented even though there are some others but I think it's it's important to share share share our wealth we are we are a source of wealth and I'd like to see Martinez and Yazzie doesn't end with our kids I think I'd like to see their parents also included so anyway I do appreciate this grass and look forward to tomorrow

[00:57:00]
and so I think I will submit those rfis and I do think we are finished with the consent agenda items and so do I need to make a motion about putting them on the agenda or does that just happen what we need to do now is go to 6.16% and then list them okay so so I will move on to item 6.1 and I'm not going to repeat this just said and so I'd like to get a motion Anna's second I will motion recommending board approval of it

[00:58:00]
disgusting the meeting today and those include August function transfers for Grant budget August enter function transferral non categorical funds District purchases or expenditures that equals or exceeds $500,000 including purchase of 6 buses New Mexico produce Growers appliances commercial and residential discount from the list from list office equipment and related supplies purchase and repair floor covering installation Floor Covering sales General Landscaping on call backflow products and supplies dance technique and instruction and finally August 2025 cash disbursement this is board member benavidez and I will second board member retail thank you for oh Dr Albright do I do we need any it's an action item do we need to take a roll call vote we do indeed okay so we are ready for that Ronaldo
